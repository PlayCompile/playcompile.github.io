<p>Alright we should be good.</p>
<p>That doesn't make sense that would be 4 minutes of hours twitch not 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>Tell them.</p>
<p>Yeah what's the an interesting video.</p>
<p>Yesterday.</p>
<p>On youtube about why wuthering wave story is so bad.</p>
<p>And star all in the lakes.</p>
<p>Sing this is this is entirely new.</p>
<p>And I think most of his points.</p>
<p>Correct he points out that all of the most of the characters could just be removed from the game and it wouldn't really make any difference what.</p>
<p>Certain flaws of the new tower of adversity has a tower is that easy now because I died with like.</p>
<p>1 second left on the clock and he had like 1 hp left and I got super mad.</p>
<p>Yeah I did get super mad.</p>
<p>Play too many of these games.</p>
<p>And there are other things that I want to do tutorials making games carding stuff like that and sometimes the upkeep of too many of these accounts.</p>
<p>6 gacha accounts.</p>
<p>I've been drastically trying to.</p>
<p>Remove the number of these games that I continually play.</p>
<p>Where so I don't feel.</p>
<p>Yeah so if you go to play.com.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>You can join our discord.</p>
<p>And it's all on now.</p>
<p>And it's all in here.</p>
<p>Be my guest thank you for the support right how about these knockdown mince they've been a really into that stuff lately.</p>
<p>Well if that's what the interface is actually.</p>
<p>But I think I think i'm still playing too many.</p>
<p>Now this kim wasn't a problem until the new event this new events kind of a bit more time consuming.</p>
<p>It's fine for now I guess because like nut ones not here yet.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>But I still I still cannot want more time to do more things that are not just me.</p>
<p>So like can I really offer anything unique to those games by streaming those games probably not.</p>
<p>Useful to.</p>
<p>Again by streaming app.</p>
<p>But I don't think I need to continue playing.</p>
<p>What is our energy right now.</p>
<p>We are capital what will we even doing I feel like we need money didn't we.</p>
<p>Weekly is as well.</p>
<p>Where does a dinosaur make.</p>
<p>Let's get some of these.</p>
<p>Do we still want to use chuang lee.</p>
<p>I don't know how do I even check intimacy.</p>
<p>Completely honest.</p>
<p>Does it saying here.</p>
<p>I don't think it does.</p>
<p>I prefer her to be honest.</p>
<p>Yes I don't know just kind of feels like at the very least i'll probably play this game like I did tara fantasy which is like.</p>
<p>Casually like yeah it would be nice to check out the new areas as the new.</p>
<p>Play I already couldn't care less.</p>
<p>Like ok so I played so I played zealous not last night and I did this incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Like final node.</p>
<p>And it took me quite a few attempts and the whole time i'm just so engaged with that combat because like every move matters right it's like oh my god i've got to be ready to do it i've got to be ready to react i've got to find the right windows to attack the enemies in like this a little bit of that here but it just feels too much like you know flash dodge flash dodge and i'm not really thinking about it cuz it's just so.</p>
<p>Shallow I guess to me it seems like the dodge mechanics are kind of shower is what.</p>
<p>An outside of the dodge mechanics what really else is there.</p>
<p>I need the echoes are fine you know it's kind of cool that I can do that but.</p>
<p>I just don't see it.</p>
<p>Engaging for me.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>It's so.</p>
<p>It's so like pleasing to play through.</p>
<p>I just I just don't get it.</p>
<p>But yeah I like I like exploring you aries in these games i'll probably do that was no reason not to like check out new areas as they come in.</p>
<p>Very casually come and do the puzzles do the new areas do the story get some new characters.</p>
<p>We've only got 40 left should we just go ahead and get these I guess i'm telling lies fully levelled I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>Off.</p>
<p>And i'm not that's the other annoying thing about it is like it probably seems like i'm being travelling but i'm not I just genuinely wanted this game would be better I just genuinely don't see that much.</p>
<p>And I wish I did.</p>
<p>I'm just being honest.</p>
<p>Are you in the withering waves going or are you in the hoyo gang and nobody's really playing both games and just being honest about them.</p>
<p>I'm not about that.</p>
<p>Just like all I want to do is be honest analyse the games from a design perspective even from a place perspective.</p>
<p>What I would do differently right.</p>
<p>Which is good.</p>
<p>Trash but it's not the masterpiece people are claiming it is.</p>
<p>It just relax a soul.</p>
<p>It lacks personality it likes charm it's just.</p>
<p>It's like they look to tara fantasy and they looked at genshin and he said oh what are the ingredients are open world right throw that in a bowl.</p>
<p>Mascot character ok so i'll be in a bowl.</p>
<p>Are cute characters ok throw on car in a bowl.</p>
<p>Story ok write some short story and throw that in the ball like it doesn't feel like.</p>
<p>A well-crafted meal you know.</p>
<p>So I can say ok what goes in arkansas.</p>
<p>Some white sauce.</p>
<p>Ingredients.</p>
<p>Sloppy inedible s*** right like yeah the ingredients are nice on their own and they're really nice together but it's not even just the nisa together it's the weather prepared and the weather meal is prepared and stuff like that.</p>
<p>All the ingredients such as being directly copy from other games and throw it or ball and then let's hope for the best.</p>
<p>It's just combat system check open world check annoying mascot check.</p>
<p>It means anything.</p>
<p>I don't feel connected to any of it on.</p>
<p>I think that's what's missing and I felt more of that was tara fantasy and tara fantasy was a s*** show let's be honest.</p>
<p>Ok it's about you know post apocalyptic.</p>
<p>Is out of this game.</p>
<p>It would still be the same disconnected mess of a game just without those characters it wouldn't change anything.</p>
<p>Connection to me.</p>
<p>You see what i'm saying that just.</p>
<p>It lacks.</p>
<p>Meaning.</p>
<p>And and personality.</p>
<p>You could rip abby out of this game and it would make any difference.</p>
<p>Mascot character.</p>
<p>Genshin impact everybody would be very confused.</p>
<p>I like what what's.</p>
<p>The main characters.</p>
<p>New point of any character in genshin impact on you can say where they're from where they belong what their personality is like.</p>
<p>You can guess things about them like ok what do you think she would like to eat what do you think she would like to wear what do you think she would say in this situation and you can get an eye you can sort of come up with a pretty definitive creative answer to that right because you kind of feel like you somewhat know the character and what they're about.</p>
<p>When is character what would boobs csr.</p>
<p>Is she good is she bad is she strong as she weak as she insecure.</p>
<p>What does she want.</p>
<p>Where is she from any of these questions cuz she's just a skin a meaningless skin.</p>
<p>She's just a exposition deliverer.</p>
<p>That's all she is.</p>
<p>Dumping laura on you.</p>
<p>With no contacts.</p>
<p>Ingredients in and of them.</p>
<p>The combat ingredient is fine.</p>
<p>Do you open world ingredient is fine I wouldn't say any of these things are like.</p>
<p>The character designs are fine.</p>
<p>The voices.</p>
<p>It's all just fine.</p>
<p>Jigsaw pieces but they don't make a sort.</p>
<p>Consistent picture with each other they're not connect to each other and mean anything when they're all pleased together.</p>
<p>With no real context.</p>
<p>So again it's like it's like being handed the lasagna ingredients in a bowl completely unprepared and you know people expecting you to enjoy a delicious lasagna as a result well.</p>
<p>Is not just the ingredients as a and it's the same for a gamma gamma just the.</p>
<p>It's not just mechanical systems it's not just characters and story it's not just sound effects and voice over it's a it's a very difficult thing to describe but it's a creative.</p>
<p>Completed units.</p>
<p>I feel like these really good games have.</p>
<p>What about the words makes it good.</p>
<p>I think it's it all boils down to what was the original intention.</p>
<p>And I think the original intention is to make money by copying genshin in both of those games cases so right away you getting off on the wrong foot if you're not trying to say anything.</p>
<p>Are you on.</p>
<p>You're just trying to tap into a market and make some money by copying somebody else then why should anybody give a s***.</p>
<p>Machine to try and make money and that's what this game is.</p>
<p>You're trying to say anything.</p>
<p>And I think that's where all comes from it's because right down at the root of the reason for it's creation if your reason for creation is just to grab a slice of the market and obviously that's going to be a sub reason in all games including like you know.</p>
<p>We're trying to do something and say something with that game.</p>
<p>Call purpose of the game right the game.</p>
<p>Is trying to do something it was trying to take like breath of the wild and grand theft auto and let you know they basically you could see there were taking systems from various other games and trying to create something new with those.</p>
<p>I think that's enough to really.</p>
<p>Give it to an identity.</p>
<p>But these copycat games can never have an identity if they're on if the whole purpose for existing is just to make money and try and.</p>
<p>And try and.</p>
<p>If that's the whole purpose for existing.</p>
<p>Game that has no personality.</p>
<p>Yeah and so far I would say tara fantasy did a better job of trying to be something.</p>
<p>Itself and say something itself.</p>
<p>Good morning alexandra how you.</p>
<p>It's just trying to get in on the market rather than say something unique itself i'll be something unique itself.</p>
<p>I'm looking at the wrong character that's why.</p>
<p>Exciting.</p>
<p>Is it a big significant difference apparently getting a graphics of dirt.</p>
<p>In the next patch.</p>
<p>What's the power.</p>
<p>There's a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Hopefully with pc boo running in rbs running and genshin running it's it doesn't hinder my frame.</p>
<p>Just letting warm are in from outside.</p>
<p>What when it comes to tariff fantasy i'm still very mad at tower fantasy I cannot believe.</p>
<p>Ok youtube chat wasn't.</p>
<p>Youtube chats not being read out.</p>
<p>Design and I don't really know what to do with it.</p>
<p>Again it goes back to that idea.</p>
<p>Bring it down and ticking boxes or what does genshin have oh a mascot character oh we don't have one ok.</p>
<p>Let's make a mascot character but again right if you just.</p>
<p>I like nexus mods.</p>
<p>Greatly improve graphics and much more.</p>
<p>Better answer anything.</p>
<p>Better draw distance.</p>
<p>Shadow draw distance and resolution increase ambient occlusion quality I wonder why is youtube chat dead then.</p>
<p>I get that.</p>
<p>What is tecton reaction to the new genshin patch and you know I was starting to you know get on board with him he started to talk about a few things but then he just goes straight to you but you know what do you expect when you know you make a game for idiots who are just idiots and that's like ok i'm just going to switch it off you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Being a child.</p>
<p>Big bald man for children in their place congratulations yes you won great but like.</p>
<p>It also says i'm captain cook and money to fix that.</p>
<p>Amazon.</p>
<p>Any started saying something about it you know yeah you know I think I think i.</p>
<p>And you built your entire career off that game what does it say about you.</p>
<p>Like you realise what you saying about yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah it's good but it's like maybe a little too little too late.</p>
<p>You know I think.</p>
<p>It's really what we should have been getting this whole time so then that kind of makes us feel like yeah we've kind of just been ignored and screwed and you know.</p>
<p>Underappreciated for 4 years and it's taken 4 years before they finally did anything about it is that good not really.</p>
<p>Should have.</p>
<p>What were the student mismanagement or just like overly you know we're at the top so we don't have to try.</p>
<p>Don't make it right.</p>
<p>Oh my god I hope that's true.</p>
<p>I hope that's true yeah that's what we've been calling for.</p>
<p>What is sauces.</p>
<p>Yeah I might look into that but.</p>
<p>Before we get into it though is there anything you want to say before we get into like I think it's like a 10-minute video or something.</p>
<p>But I thought this video was very insightful.</p>
<p>It's sort of.</p>
<p>Can't play this good.</p>
<p>That is really hard that no it's 7 I cannot figure out some of those timings.</p>
<p>I'll try to summarise what he said then but basically he said he said the problem with the storytelling is everybody sounds like a robot and worse and they only purposes to dump exposition on you so they're not saying anything that a character should say right they just sound like an encyclopaedia dumping law on you and that's everything is set up as like an exposition dump.</p>
<p>Which is why nobody feels like an actual character he said that the other problem with it is you could rip 90% of the characters out of the game and it wouldn't change the story in any meaningful workers nothing really connects on means anything I really really want but yeah.</p>
<p>Previously so that's why I follow him.</p>
<p>And I agree with most of what he says.</p>
<p>Here is is basically saying you know wow it's just the writing is sore but in this game it's it's amazing anybody gives a s*** about it.</p>
<p>I think you said highlights what's bad about it.</p>
<p>Pretty well.</p>
<p>Do I need to do any more of this I mean there's no good rewards from anymore is there.</p>
<p>Not particularly.</p>
<p>I'm interested in like trying to figure out what it is that makes you know games feel like they have good story in bad story because obviously if I want to make games.</p>
<p>How are you now I would like it if my story was good so it's I think it's helpful.</p>
<p>What makes a good story and what makes a bad story in a game.</p>
<p>What are the biggest issues that asia has specifically I would say is.</p>
<p>They do have a different attention span than we do.</p>
<p>Are you going to do is like watch japanese films or japanese tv shows to understand this they're piercing is much more passion than I was and I think sometimes when something becomes a global product that comes from asia it's not a pissed more for the asian audience than the western audience and I think it would help them a lot if they kind of I mean i'm not saying they should change the entire structure because maybe that's a bit unfair.</p>
<p>Might get a bit.</p>
<p>Overall if they found new ways to deliver story during gameplay if they can if they can solve that problem I think that would be amazing because for me I tend to get impatient.</p>
<p>Will it be like mostly a story.</p>
<p>But an action game and I think that's the problem right these are action games that have big long stories and it's like I mean in action game I kind of want some action you know and I do get kind of impatient and restless if the story is drag on for too long even engaging.</p>
<p>They give you part 1 part 2 and part 3 and 3 separate chapters so you can you have to go in and like pick each part if you want to play all in one go and I think that's great because it gives you the opportunity to sort of gone break it up and do something else in the middle and it doesn't feel quite so cumbersome.</p>
<p>I can't even imagine how bad it was before.</p>
<p>Will the previous manager of genshin.</p>
<p>If he has been replaced.</p>
<p>And some other guy can't remember his name.</p>
<p>Kenshin.</p>
<p>Manager.</p>
<p>There's a ton of them actually get to my look at all these games and monitors.</p>
<p>Skin managers.</p>
<p>Kitchen manager.</p>
<p>Joined.</p>
<p>Is that the prostate.</p>
<p>I know the manager used to be here we go.</p>
<p>Nfpc with the name manager in the tile.</p>
<p>Ok genshin.</p>
<p>Hiya partner manager.</p>
<p>Yeah you're right.</p>
<p>Google is not the search engine.</p>
<p>Google is so bad now.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Shanghai mccoy network pretty sure he was managing genshin.</p>
<p>Yes it's him yes.</p>
<p>Play we hit as ginger players.</p>
<p>In 2021 hong kong.</p>
<p>How to crossover event with genshin impacts.</p>
<p>Pretty sure he was the manager.</p>
<p>2014 once in regards to criticism of one of the games he was working on way basically said if you want to play it player if you don't want to play it then f*** off basically scrum.</p>
<p>Who's not very good at taking criticism.</p>
<p>Ask kind of all lights up does not.</p>
<p>Can you send new management.</p>
<p>Recent attack on kyle that was 20 year 2024.</p>
<p>Recent attack on chi producer of genshin 7 months ago.</p>
<p>Over 40% stick with him he is also the chairman of mahaya ever since the company existed yet because he founded company with the main reason i'm going back there again impact exist in the first place that doesn't that doesn't matter who cares if he's mismanaging again is mismanaging a game it doesn't matter whether it wouldn't be you wouldn't you wouldn't even have the game if it wasn't him in the first place that's just.</p>
<p>Saying you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Separate issues.</p>
<p>So why impact third engagement is on friendly to gamers during his lead ok.</p>
<p>Simple reason they need huge resource to develop genshin it's the company's biggest gamble ever to date.</p>
<p>The early.</p>
<p>The early 3 year of hong kong book 3rd earning is solely to funding their next project in which is genshin initially they thought they just need about 150 dev's to be enough to handle all genshin development.</p>
<p>This is yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Take more money away from hunger third budget.</p>
<p>To finish developing genshin.</p>
<p>How you make billions in genshin and you don't want to give any of it back to the players.</p>
<p>You don't even giving them anything you just like you could give like this three five star that we're all getting does it cost him anything not really now maybe you could argue that would have been potential spending that is now not being spent but I would say in the long term they're probably making more money because like.</p>
<p>No you more likely to get more loyal players that way by treating them well and then they're probably going to spend money further on it's it's a very difficult thing to calculate.</p>
<p>Maybe new players and that's about it.</p>
<p>But even then I don't think many people are.</p>
<p>Intention after 1.0 release diddy cuz that's not what i've heard for some reason only concern got a new producer to replace and genshin has known shut up you sing genshin has no producer since 1.0 don't be f****** stupid.</p>
<p>Project pgs edge.</p>
<p>Pjs.</p>
<p>Chairman of mahiya.</p>
<p>Seeing so many people mad about a guy that has nothing to do with gedge anymore is a bit of a shock to me some even say just fire the guy it's so hilarious to see but I can see why everyone is so frustrated about it.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>It's literally them riding on the popularity of genshin to get some people.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>Nice argument that you have there but why don't you back it up with a sauce in game development the one spot you can't just leave open as game director you have to have that filled filled even if you just put the name of your coffee by the I don't know I just think that how you would rather not have the game that attracted the global attention not have a direct alike kai normally operate under the practice of handling it off and then working on a new thing so again you're not having a game director isn't what chi would normally do.</p>
<p>Play kept being honkai impact three's director until.</p>
<p>Why would he abandoned genshin.</p>
<p>The rewards are worth it to be honest.</p>
<p>Because I need one more to do.</p>
<p>Play this again I guess.</p>
<p>And then I pretty much run out of stuff to do in this game.</p>
<p>I know that mobile still supposed to have a lot of issues apparently.</p>
<p>Optimised game especially for mobile and will it be in unreal unreal is not really as sort of you know built around multi-platform as much it's more of a pc game engine so I know that unreal catching up with some of that like additional platform support whereas unit was kind of built from the ground up like that.</p>
<p>Laptop.</p>
<p>Yeah it is quite demanding now.</p>
<p>Man used to like as well to be honest and i've got like a r t rtx 2017.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Stop bad.</p>
<p>Yeah I mean outside of maybe tinkering with your settings and trying to turn them down I don't know what else to suggest really.</p>
<p>6 star.</p>
<p>Yeah for me I feel like the game did become a little bit more optimised cos I don't get the as much lag as I used to get.</p>
<p>Ok so apparently I can upgrade this one.</p>
<p>Yeah still still laggy.</p>
<p>Turn my lighting up.</p>
<p>Yeah I know genshin is start experimenting with this weird cloud thing now where you can play through the cloud if you don't have like the power or whatever to play elsewhere you can play online.</p>
<p>A cloud service that they charge money for.</p>
<p>Optimised because the tag well I mean this game is targeting mobile but I think the main reason for that is just unity because they built in unity game engine that's what I used all the time and because unit it was built from the ground up with like mobile.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But yeah it's the reason for it is basically unreal engine is pc engine.</p>
<p>What does aid hire.</p>
<p>That's why they kind of pride themselves on all the realistic graphics and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Shut the bed last year.</p>
<p>Can I struggle with mobile optimisation and stuff.</p>
<p>Guess the engine just wasn't really built from the ground up with that in mind.</p>
<p>Knowledge and teamwork.</p>
<p>Go back to run out of credits.</p>
<p>Action and teamwork.</p>
<p>She's good for action but not necessarily teamwork.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Yeah but I think the way.</p>
<p>Play shield I think the way shield works.</p>
<p>I think you need to either own the game on steam.</p>
<p>I don't think it's on steam.</p>
<p>Stream the games on through steam and it's streams the the game on their servers are you can stream from a faster pc to a slow pc so if I had a gaming pc in the living room and I wanted to play on a shity pc in the bedroom I could stream it from one pc to the next.</p>
<p>But if the games not on steam which I don't think withering waves is.</p>
<p>Nvidia shield basically is a collab with steam.</p>
<p>Pretty sure you have to have them on steam.</p>
<p>Are you still.</p>
<p>Shield tv.</p>
<p>World class streaming media performance.</p>
<p>How to stream games on nvidia shield.</p>
<p>Onto a slower pc.</p>
<p>How to stream.</p>
<p>G-force now is the one I think that we use a.</p>
<p>Which one do you oh my god.</p>
<p>Ok you can do it with shield apparently.</p>
<p>Yeah so check your local steam.</p>
<p>And you might be able to stream it.</p>
<p>Transform.</p>
<p>To find the web page in the information that they want instead of google because google is just.</p>
<p>Essentially all it does now.</p>
<p>Sponsored results.</p>
<p>Do you want to stream it with something like nvidia shield I think it has to be in your steam library.</p>
<p>So yeah you should be able to you should be able to stream it if it's on steam.</p>
<p>Shield.</p>
<p>Which I think is a paid service.</p>
<p>Why can't google just find anything actually it's my name google you know it is brave search no wonder I can't find anything.</p>
<p>But I think you need one of these don't you.</p>
<p>Well yeah if you don't have the power if you don't have a powerful enough pc there's no other way to do it other than the streamer.</p>
<p>Yeah if your if your pc can't.</p>
<p>Process all the data locally than the other the only other option is to have a server do it for you.</p>
<p>Like do you remember.</p>
<p>Google what the hell is that thing called.</p>
<p>I think that's the g-force now one that is not but she was now is.</p>
<p>Be a g-force now can stream your steam library but it's a subscription service.</p>
<p>But there might be a free trial.</p>
<p>Okay okay you can play for an hour for free.</p>
<p>After that it's 9.99 a month.</p>
<p>Cheaper than buying a new pc.</p>
<p>But there you are running options sadly.</p>
<p>This is not powerful enough to play the game the only other option is to do something like this.</p>
<p>You can play test it for an hour for free.</p>
<p>And then after that apparently it's 9.99.</p>
<p>I guess like I say if you play a lot of games and you know you can't afford a new pc it's an option isn't it.</p>
<p>Yeah good luck with that.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm trying it for an hour.</p>
<p>I did I did try it once you remember when cyberpunk came out.</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>Unplayable.</p>
<p>Yeah I bought it on day release and it was quite lucky but I was also trying to put on like max settings so I heard people were playing it through g-force now and I think it was free I think it was all free back then cuz there was still trialling it so you could definitely play for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Things to be honest.</p>
<p>Absolute sure I need the credits donna.</p>
<p>We can do some more now.</p>
<p>It's large wishes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Good enough.</p>
<p>A b.</p>
<p>You gotta be.</p>
<p>Action and teamwork.</p>
<p>Yeah if your patience.</p>
<p>I think they will make improvements.</p>
<p>Maybe try it when the next big patch comes out.</p>
<p>I think the next big patch is coming.</p>
<p>But I think it's somewhere like that.</p>
<p>This event is so tedious i'm not gonna lie.</p>
<p>It's very tedious.</p>
<p>When is stanley tedious.</p>
<p>I don't even know what i'm doing it.</p>
<p>I can't help myself i'm like a moth to a.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I'm like a.</p>
<p>Meth head to a.</p>
<p>Jesse pinkman you know.</p>
<p>I need you to I need you to save me.</p>
<p>I need you to save me from myself.</p>
<p>Ok we're done.</p>
<p>See I quit.</p>
<p>I didn't I left go away.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Play me a long.</p>
<p>Ok we do have genshin that we need to prep for matalan.</p>
<p>I bought about.</p>
<p>Update the launcher you say.</p>
<p>What does that say connect to the infinite world.</p>
<p>You know i'm probably going to do one of these in unity soon I like this oil launcher where they stick up stuff all the games into it.</p>
<p>Is a brilliant idea can't believe it took them this long I think of it so I might do a similar thing where I do like a play compile launcher and you can get my money games and they show up just to show you how it's done and how we can do it.</p>
<p>And also you know.</p>
<p>Does projects up to date if you want to play one of my games you can blah blah it's cool and I can show you how to do all this I can do all this.</p>
<p>It's cooler.</p>
<p>Jelly.</p>
<p>Put jill bass.</p>
<p>How about the jelly I still said jelly.</p>
<p>Don't arrest me.</p>
<p>I bought the daily gem.</p>
<p>I bought the gym pass.</p>
<p>Falcon moon.</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>But the thing is right.</p>
<p>I now have a better weapon for my nadia.</p>
<p>I am going to have a 50/50 at shark girl.</p>
<p>There's no way i'm not getting drill girl right cos i've got like i've worked it out with the anniversary rewards and everything.</p>
<p>About 50 something paul's i'm already at 20 pity.</p>

<p>Why is brave such so bad.</p>
<p>You know what.</p>

<p>I need to save my.</p>
<p>I need to save my resin.</p>
<p>What will I do now.</p>
<p>Need to level this weapon which is the battle pass weapon.</p>
<p>But typical genshin.</p>
<p>Won't let me do it.</p>

<p>So I guess i'm condensing some resonates.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>I have maximum.</p>
<p>Where are they.</p>
<p>It's a very long walk wait hang on.</p>
<p>You said south.</p>
<p>Is southwest more like.</p>
<p>It's time on conspiracy.</p>
<p>I do get a little bit of lag in this game sometimes.</p>
<p>It's fine when i'm not streaming.</p>
<p>You can see it starts to struggle about.</p>
<p>Watch it.</p>
<p>You don't know how strong my siege win is.</p>
<p>You asked for a.</p>
<p>120 m away.</p>
<p>And it's at the top of the hills going to take me all day to get up there.</p>
<p>Yeah I could probably get rid of it.</p>
<p>If I just load my settings but it's not too bad and I stream at 30fps so I play at 60 fps but I stream at 30 so the way I see it as long as it looks ok for you guys at 30 then i'm not too bothered about.</p>
<p>I can definitely feel it's starting to struggle a little bit.</p>
<p>Play normally just.</p>
<p>Beer for me it's because I run my ai assistant.</p>
<p>Resources as well I stream on two platforms at once.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>I'm the age land on them thank you.</p>

<p>Took some offer.</p>
<p>929 on my heater now just the word of warning.</p>
<p>That wasn't about 1200 at one point and then I read somewhere that it was capped so at a certain point I think it's like captain like 800 or something weird like 89 so at a certain point it's like ok you're not even getting anything for it so I just.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what the cat is but it is definitely caps.</p>
<p>Which is hilarious cos I never really used it a trigger reactions I was used carrara now.</p>

<p>30 minutes.</p>
<p>To help the freshman quickly grasp but the various terms circulating in samaru in a nutshell it's to explain complicated nouns in the form of questions and answers this way it'll be more efficient and interesting for students to learn.</p>

<p>Usually.</p>
<p>From asia some in the uk.</p>
<p>Ingrid england.</p>
<p>Business as usual.</p>
<p>Alright so.</p>
<p>Mushrooms.</p>

<p>Is it cold here actually it's quite warm it was a little bit I wouldn't say called but it was cool yesterday.</p>
<p>Call and cool which.</p>
<p>Again today.</p>
<p>Yes it's quite warm.</p>
<p>Only place i've been in asia is japan.</p>
<p>Which I studied japanese in kyoto.</p>
<p>And yeah the weather there is very similar to I was.</p>
<p>Set it reminds me when I was in japan actually.</p>
<p>I was had a part of my account but it was very loud.</p>
<p>Ohio yeah.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Play talking now.</p>
<p>Roll 15 years something like that and so our weather is changed in that time we're getting heatwaves now that we.</p>
<p>Changing.</p>
<p>It was very human when I was there.</p>
<p>I can't we did it.</p>
<p>Daily commissions don.</p>
<p>I need some - 6 more items but we'll do that from catherine when we go get our award.</p>
<p>Cuz usually.</p>
<p>Our expedition or whatever does that.</p>
<p>So we can do that.</p>
<p>But I also don't want to waste my resin.</p>
<p>So we need to.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Indeed catherine.</p>
<p>How have you been nice to.</p>
<p>I see you look in the same as always.</p>
<p>Ok we did so that would have been.</p>
<p>Yeah that's the mining so now I just need to.</p>
<p>150 resin the problem with that.</p>
<p>Yeah I really.</p>
<p>Very cold.</p>
<p>Is it near norway cos i'll be similar temperatures if it is.</p>
<p>Ignore me it's no anyway I thought it was.</p>
<p>Yeah helsinki.</p>
<p>Let's find out finland.</p>
<p>Weather.</p>
<p>So right now it's 20.</p>
<p>Play warm.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>So that's the weather right now.</p>
<p>I guess i'm just looking for.</p>
<p>Weather in climate in finland here we.</p>
<p>As the saying goes the climate is what we expect in the weather is what we get finland has four unique seasons the temperature in finland varies greatly by season and by region as the country is long and has different coastal and inland climates so I guess it depends where about chihuahuas well.</p>
<p>Is the atlantic ocean to the west and the.</p>
<p>Changing climate and finland hottest month is typically july coldest is january in febuary due to our country's location the weather can also change quickly which makes predicting a bit tricky you just kind of what we get as well we always say that as british can never make plans because you never know it's going to rain never know when it's just gonna go crazy.</p>
<p>We recommend checking the weather in the morning before heading out so you'll know exactly how to dress as comfortable and as warm as possible yeah we have similar.</p>
<p>In the uk we're very it's very unpredictable.</p>
<p>Pack for window.</p>
<p>A beanie scarf wooly socks went boots on a thick jacket or essential looks like you'll be getting snow.</p>
<p>Oh that's very cold.</p>
<p>Helsinki is the warmest.</p>
<p>What's -3.5 in january.</p>
<p>That's very cold.</p>
<p>How does cold as robin me.</p>
<p>- 13.1.</p>
<p>Yeah so it looks like it's warmest in helsinki in the winter.</p>
<p>Coldest in roman emmy.</p>
<p>Which parts stores in the south right.</p>
<p>I'm guessing wrong name is in the north.</p>
<p>See I think it depends where about you going to be as well.</p>
<p>You know that I never touch snow before not even.</p>
<p>A little.</p>
<p>Yeah we don't get snow that much in england anymore we used to when I was younger.</p>
<p>Make the most snow I ever saw was in norway.</p>
<p>Yeah I saw so much snow in norway I was crazy but yeah do you do any skiing it's going to be great for skiing if you want to try that.</p>
<p>Snowboarding is good for that.</p>
<p>Yeah I like cold winter's the as long as i'm getting warm summer's I think cold winter is a girl because it's nice variation you know.</p>
<p>And there's nothing better than being all snuggled up in front of a fire looking outside it's snowing and you like nice and warm of course it's.</p>
<p>Sun sunburn.</p>
<p>So even even in the snow it's not always necessarily called and I think the sun reflects off the snow really well.</p>
<p>What kind of.</p>
<p>Text away some of that cold I think.</p>
<p>It was quite bizarre actually.</p>
<p>Maybe I will.</p>
<p>Kids bounties what is my battle pass need.</p>
<p>We can do this and then just not collect the mats right we can do that.</p>
<p>Can I suspend some money.</p>
<p>You mean like one week and 14 hours less than a year.</p>
<p>Ok when switching oh I can do some genius.</p>
<p>I will try.</p>
<p>Ok let's try and do some tcg I guess.</p>
<p>I need to win two rounds so it can't be that bad.</p>
<p>I always go to the wrong door ok.</p>
<p>We've got lots of red dots that drive me insane ok how do I get these red dots.</p>
<p>How do I get the red dots.</p>
<p>That's that's the online.</p>
<p>I'm not great i'm not great but I do normally win.</p>
<p>And I only use one deck I don't change dixie either I just.</p>
<p>All right let's see how it goes let's find out.</p>
<p>I saw first of all I find somebody who I think will suck I think charlotte's gonna suck.</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>Let's go let's go girl.</p>
<p>Show me what you got to come on.</p>
<p>Get rid of anything that doesn't help us write.</p>
<p>I don't like those.</p>
<p>What I tend to do is I keep my electro buffs and my hydro buffs and the omni ones are good.</p>
<p>So i'm going to get rid of these two.</p>
<p>Ok I build up some charge on call me so that she can get ready to heal or do some like you know big ass things what i'm going to do I don't need dandruff.</p>
<p>I don't need fire I don't need wind.</p>
<p>I'll keep the other two.</p>
<p>Jellyfish.</p>
<p>A big ass who me.</p>
<p>Well yeah but what's new.</p>
<p>So jellyfish goes down.</p>
<p>So let's see what cars we've got.</p>
<p>When you play tarot card users skills spend one less lateral that cost me to this one's free the next time you perform switch character a fast action instead of a combat it's free so there's no reason not to play it right so i'm going to play that.</p>
<p>How many moves do I have or whatever.</p>
<p>I have a couple of.</p>
<p>Ice ones.</p>
<p>I want to get that healing back of the jellyfish lotto ever healing card.</p>
<p>And I use my two ice dice.</p>
<p>Erica don.</p>
<p>How do I pass my turn.</p>
<p>Turn android on there we go.</p>
<p>Charles quest.</p>
<p>End affairs.</p>
<p>There we go i'll get some healing back now.</p>
<p>I just realised i'm being all cocky and I haven't caused any damage to my opponent whatsoever that is probably not a good sign ok well let's rethink things we don't need dandruff or pyro that's for sure.</p>
<p>Flash charlotte now.</p>
<p>Charged up.</p>
<p>Yeah also i'm trying to think how this works.</p>
<p>Right if I was to do kokomis old.</p>
<p>And i've got two electric dice so this should be good.</p>
<p>Ok I could do one more of these though.</p>
<p>When you're active characters could change.</p>
<p>Ok let's do it.</p>
<p>One dangerous let's go.</p>
<p>Indeed let's do it right now.</p>
<p>If I use this card.</p>
<p>Insufficient elemental dice ok how do I change dice again.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>It's all coming back to me now.</p>
<p>I've run out of date so i'm gonna have to end the round I think.</p>
<p>Are the healing.</p>
<p>This is not looking good for me ok.</p>
<p>Characters.</p>
<p>Can we turn those into things.</p>
<p>Use this I think.</p>
<p>On kitchen.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>And now we can use let it go.</p>
<p>Where the cargo oh no did I use i'm using the cards to do the dice or no I just.</p>
<p>I just threw that car to wear.</p>
<p>I forgot that part yes I should have used this card I can't never mind so I might lose this one because I forgotten how this bloody game works alright it's fine I might as well just use this because it's.</p>
<p>It's kind of neck and neck right now.</p>
<p>That's good but it's going to cost me.</p>
<p>I will take for joining.</p>
<p>And I will maybe catch you again in future.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>So now i've got the three stars if I just convert.</p>
<p>What does that do.</p>
<p>She costs too much what am I doing switch to cook me so she's ready for the next round so I can drop a jellyfish and he'll catching and then got a kitchen and do the kitchens old.</p>
<p>Set they don't have any moves left thank god.</p>
<p>As long as I go first i'll be fine.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I was supposed to start first.</p>
<p>Are great now you give me all electric dyes now that i'm cooking.</p>
<p>So why can't i.</p>
<p>Lol tuning.</p>
<p>Select the day arthur.</p>
<p>So if I do the old every attack heals my entire party which is great I need to also drop a jellyfish.</p>
<p>And i'm a good to like what buses catching after that.</p>
<p>That's for this.</p>
<p>Turn the heal everybody.</p>
<p>I got two days left ok that's really good so I can switch.</p>
<p>I can switch to kitchen right I think.</p>
<p>Why is cockney.</p>
<p>At that store she just is it is what it is I can't do this can i.</p>
<p>How are they doing so well they've healed their entire party oh my god this is so bad.</p>
<p>Destroy me.</p>
<p>Any just for the frozen make a chain this is actually insane ok i'm defrost it now.</p>
<p>Why do you give me coconut ice when i'm catching and catching days when i'm talking about.</p>
<p>Eat my olds.</p>
<p>They're still alive though.</p>
<p>Which is good.</p>
<p>What do I do now should I switch to talk to me.</p>
<p>Advantage of that.</p>
<p>That sounded really bad.</p>
<p>It came out wrong ok it wasn't supposed to sound like that right.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do anymore.</p>
<p>Next time you use a skill switcher next character to be the active character.</p>
<p>Yeah let's do that and we'll take it off call amy I guess.</p>
<p>Ok yes and round.</p>
<p>This really could go either way though.</p>
<p>It looks like i'm kind of winning.</p>
<p>What are you clipping no.</p>
<p>No don't do it.</p>
<p>Barbra streisand.</p>
<p>Can you use the rules ok let's let's do that instead then let's see huge.</p>
<p>Activate games one energy we don't need it.</p>
<p>Embrace my magical tickle.</p>
<p>With one dice acres cheap.</p>
<p>So the number one means one dice of that element but the number two next it means two dice and tool.</p>
<p>Yes so i've got two days until so why can't I do it.</p>
<p>I don't know why I can't do it.</p>
<p>Clearly lies.</p>
<p>It's still won't let me do it what the frick.</p>
<p>Why won't it let me do it though.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>In which case i've wasted an element.</p>
<p>How are you healing all the time at charlotte I hate you so much.</p>
<p>Oh my god look how many cards they get yes cuz I want to know mine.</p>
<p>Ok that was good though.</p>
<p>What kind of.</p>
<p>This is not looking good for me.</p>
<p>I attack first will thank god something goes my way we don't want that one we don't want that one.</p>
<p>Put the the coast guard comes out and then the coast guard has like a little chibi character with her and then I could have a team of chibis and that might be fun.</p>
<p>Mary.</p>
<p>Switch characters right now.</p>
<p>I need to save aika.</p>
<p>I have to say my account ok.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>

<p>What is this card do draw two cars will do something.</p>
<p>I got to do something.</p>
<p>Oh my god she's at full health charlotte such a b**** why are you such a b**** next time you phone switch action switch character use one less elemental dice what character i've got nobody else left.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is horrendous this is actually horrendous.</p>
<p>This is so bad.</p>
<p>I can't do anything you fool.</p>
<p>Go on kill me.</p>
<p>Go and get off with.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous she's almost full health are you seeing this are you seeing this insanity why is this why is it so hard this isn't getting this is where the real difficult isn't it real and game this is the hardest game ever.</p>
<p>Right I don't really have any options.</p>
<p>If I elemental tune i'm as well again go out with a bang all right but this is about as good as it gets.</p>
<p>I want to die here.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is just brutal it's so brutal.</p>
<p>I'm in ptsd i'm going to get ptsd from this phone.</p>
<p>End round whatever.</p>
<p>Just get it over with.</p>
<p>Well we've got speed up mod for the next one.</p>
<p>Shut the hell up f*** you oh my god shut the hell up I want to rematch shut the don't even don't even speak to me I swear to god you're gonna die this time I swear to god why was she so good like I made one miss well I put him in my mum.</p>
<p>Why was corby.</p>
<p>Right and then we lay the foundation.</p>
<p>The driver jellyfish.</p>
<p>Feeling.</p>
<p>When you play atomic card or character use a.</p>
<p>Shut the hell up.</p>
<p>Right do a healing.</p>
<p>What choice do I have.</p>
<p>Which is my shortest card probably this one.</p>
<p>I just realised why it's because chi chi and charlotte are both eyes so like.</p>
<p>Why why would you do that to me.</p>
<p>Oh my god why.</p>
<p>Single hydro dice are you actually shipped me right now.</p>
<p>To be fair my my kokomis almost back up to full house.</p>
<p>So now might be a good time to switch characters anywhere.</p>
<p>Switch character.</p>
<p>Where's fast mode.</p>
<p>Change settings.</p>
<p>I'm still doing that.</p>
<p>Spanking.</p>
<p>Use that.</p>
<p>Why am I so dumb why would it let you give that card to call me when she's not electric that's so stupid I thought I didn't think it would actually asked me who do I want.</p>
<p>I've only got one electric charger on the.</p>
<p>Whatever I just wasted a card fantastic.</p>
<p>Is ashley dumb.</p>
<p>Lml tuning.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>It just used the wrong card again and.</p>
<p>Give the wrong.</p>
<p>Discounted card to the wrong f****** character give it a cockney it's because this interface sucks.</p>
<p>How does it make sense right that the first thing you asked me to pick is the card I want to discard and then you pick then you say you want to element or tune shouldn't it be the other way around they say I want to elemental tune and then I pick which card I wanted scared that would make more sense but that's not how it works it's so dumb.</p>
<p>Oh my god i'm not right I just just give up just give up concede just f*** off.</p>
<p>She's absolutely awful.</p>
<p>Shut the f****** I swear to god I want to kick you so hard right.</p>
<p>Chef matthew.</p>
<p>Just to get the just to get the rewards from the battle pass that I paid money file it's ridiculous race ok.</p>
<p>Will you s*** cars for elementary and what not anywhere but there's always a chance that you can get about a card that's actually good.</p>
<p>So yeah whatever I guess.</p>
<p>There's no way this won't work.</p>
<p>I want to stop by laying a jellyfish.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>Do I have to end around.</p>
<p>What the f*** dude.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me cookies half dead already I didn't do anything.</p>
<p>I need the full health.</p>
<p>Oh my god what is this.</p>
<p>I swear they made this game so much harder.</p>
<p>Oh wow it'll do zero damage fantastic apparently cook me is completely useless so now i've got to do zero damage just to charge your alts just so that I can heal.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is so dumb.</p>
<p>Is it actually so dumb.</p>
<p>How about that.</p>
<p>What do you mean zero this makes no sense why can't I do any damage to him.</p>
<p>Do you know where I can do damage is if I had cookies and then it would do 3 damage to the other two but it's still wouldn't do any damage to him in the middle that doesn't make you sit what the f*** is going on with the guy in the middle then this makes no sense oh my god how is this game fair.</p>
<p>What is even happening.</p>
<p>I don't understand I do not understand why can I not do any damage to it makes no f****** sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>Choose one someone on your side and run it plus one usage.</p>
<p>Jellyfish.</p>
<p>What is a jellyfish all damage in probably not one of my f****** breath.</p>
<p>What about this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ok what else I mean I might as well just use this doesn't cost any dice but it's also going to do zero damage what's the f****** point I suppose the point is it gives me a charge.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is so dumb I literally can't cause any damage to him but he takes three off me yeah totally fair and balanced game totally.</p>
<p>Why not.</p>
<p>Oh my god are you kidding me.</p>
<p>So you do 6 damage and I do zero is that that's how this game works what a great game.</p>
<p>What a great game i'm so much fun right now.</p>
<p>It should be called ready up the ass with no lube the card game that's what it should be called not f****** tcg.</p>
<p>One damage wow we were making that's an improvement i'll take it.</p>
<p>Ok now what.</p>
<p>I can do another one apparently.</p>
<p>Have zero damage fantastic can you do anything cos this is actually insane why is everybody so useless it doesn't make any sense but use this cos we need to heal right.</p>
<p>Because to dice.</p>
<p>That's fine now.</p>
<p>Element.</p>
<p>Can I use the dendro in the omni then.</p>
<p>F*** you.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>It's so good it's like hey toddler let me just hang off your hands behind your back and throw you in the ring with mike tyson good luck enjoy.</p>
<p>Play wow.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I think I should just switch the clock on me I don't know what else to do.</p>
<p>I don't think she can do any damage but at least I can heal back up.</p>
<p>What else am I supposed to do.</p>
<p>This is so stupid why can't I do any damage it makes no sense.</p>
<p>What is cod.</p>
<p>Can I see the mother f*** is getting.</p>
<p>Wow great to shields.</p>
<p>So we'll have 10 shields you'll have none.</p>
<p>Totally fair game.</p>
<p>I use this one then I say elemental tune which seems backwards to me but whatever.</p>
<p>Can I pick the dice I feel like.</p>
<p>Old cockney go to two damage going to give some health back to the chin and some health.</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me seven damage what the hell.</p>
<p>Are you actually kidding me.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Can I even do 944.</p>
<p>Four elemental dies to do the old.</p>
<p>Hello create two on the elemental days what would be the point.</p>
<p>You're so dumb.</p>
<p>Suspend two days to create two omni elemental dies.</p>
<p>I swear that i'm about to die and i.</p>
<p>I'm gonna die.</p>
<p>Does it in the round.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Don't hit me.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And then because that m*********** shielded we waste our alt against him.</p>
<p>Because you got two shield.</p>
<p>I need to finish him.</p>
<p>For some reason I guess because they're both got electric that will spread so we can kill him that would be better because it uses less dice right zeroid ice.</p>
<p>Why does it ask me to use two dice.</p>
<p>That's why.</p>
<p>It just needs to zero elemental ok let's do that then cos that will kill him.</p>
<p>Is the issue.</p>
<p>Do I have any healing cards.</p>
<p>Ok next time you use the skills switch.</p>
<p>Your next character to be the active character this might be what I need this will protect catching I think so if I use this device.</p>
<p>I can do what I was just about to do and then I think it switches straight to acre which is good because then he can't kill kachang and she's still got a roll up.</p>
<p>All right that's what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>Right he's got one more shield so we just do whatever to him right because like he's going to absorb it anywhere.</p>
<p>I didn't get that money.</p>
<p>No you must you must have missed yesterday so you got both at once.</p>
<p>Right so he's going to absorb it anywhere so we'll just do whatever right.</p>
<p>Why isn't he shielded.</p>
<p>Hydro.</p>
<p>How does that make any sense.</p>
<p>The only reason I can think that that would be the case noise a hydro bismid she's not even cryer cos the only reason I could think that that would happen is if he was crying and I just attacked him with cryo so he's like resistant or whatever but he's a hydra I just attacked him with my cryo and he didn't lose his shield what the f***.</p>
<p>This game is already brutal and then like it feels like it's not even working properly.</p>
<p>Do it again and why don't you what would be the point.</p>
<p>I have so much.</p>
<p>Have I got a way to end around or something is that why.</p>
<p>This is not let me do anything.</p>
<p>I guess like i'm supposed to end around so i'm probably going to die now anyway.</p>
<p>That is so unfair.</p>
<p>How is it that I hit him and he still has his shield that makes no sense.</p>
<p>This is so stupid.</p>
<p>This is already hard enough.</p>
<p>Yeah I just I don't even know why he didn't.</p>
<p>Okay i'm going to do it again but the last time I did this it didn't take his shield away.</p>
<p>So if it does the same thing again i'm going to be so mad because I just don't understand why it doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>He has won shield right now i'm hitting him with a cryo attack.</p>
<p>He's hydra there's no reason they shouldn't take a shield away.</p>
<p>And it didn't I don't understand that doesn't make any sense I don't understand why that doesn't take his shield away.</p>
<p>I love what botulism.</p>
<p>What what kind of question is that.</p>
<p>You're not defined by your what you could what a doctor can write about you on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>I know there's a big that's that's what a lot of people do not everybody seems to want to advertise everything that a doctor would write on a on some kind of.</p>
<p>Your current active character gains 1 angie i'm f***** anywhere essentially.</p>
<p>Shielded.</p>
<p>This is so rigged I don't understand why the attacks from ikea didn't destroy a shield.</p>
<p>Just feel so unfair.</p>
<p>Damage.</p>
<p>Talk to me now.</p>
<p>I can't do anything now.</p>
<p>How does it seem like I was clueless on what artisan is I don't want to order with autism is.</p>
<p>I was making a joke about botulism.</p>
<p>Could you ask me stupid questions all the time and I was trying to concentrate on this.</p>
<p>You don't really care then there.</p>
<p>Why won't it let me do anything what is that spinning mean this is going to be some b******* isn't it.</p>
<p>I bet the spinning thing means something weird.</p>
<p>I think all I can do is in my round.</p>
<p>But I don't know why.</p>
<p>Have I got a mouse pointer on my screen.</p>
<p>If it would actually just let me take a turn have you seen how rig this is.</p>
<p>Is that i'm just going to get f***** no matter what I do i'm just getting f***** I please like him when he has a shield and he doesn't lose his shield it puts me in a situation where all I have to do is attacking once.</p>
<p>Play and his dad.</p>
<p>He gets to attack me three times and i'm frozen and can't move just magically and then he kills me at the end like what the how does that feel like I like games that feel fair I don't like games that just feel like f****** bulshit like what did that spinning thing even mean it's so dumb.</p>
<p>Big surprise it does 0 damage as usual.</p>
<p>Hydro slime with my hyd.</p>
<p>Grass.</p>
<p>So once again the game finds a great way to f****** right from the start of the game.</p>
<p>So now what I do I just don't even know.</p>
<p>Switch characters I guess I don't f***.</p>
<p>So much worse than it used to be though like it was already pretty s*** to be honest but it used to like let you.</p>
<p>You already know the why do you ask questions you already know the answers to.</p>
<p>Am I excited for the update when you already know you already know that I am why would I have time is all over my stream about it and stuff why would I not be excited for the big patch of my favourite game you know the answer.</p>
<p>Why do you ask let me ask you a question why do you ask questions that you already know the answer.</p>
<p>It just seems strange to me.</p>
<p>I don't understand that.</p>
<p>Help me understand.</p>
<p>Like it comes when it comes.</p>
<p>Are you you do this a lot as well like a games come like like you were talking about that what was that game you talking about the non-stop the next tariff fantasy one and you talk about it talk about it i'm like you do realise it's going to be months away and like if you keep putting this amount of energy you know it's going to feel you're going to be burnt out from before the game even comes out.</p>
<p>When you first mentioned it.</p>
<p>Use one summit on your side.</p>
<p>Rented plus one.</p>
<p>Big surprise.</p>
<p>Strange.</p>
<p>What the hell that's so weird.</p>
<p>Why does it say e is the captain that's really weird.</p>
<p>Which is weird.</p>
<p>Changing.</p>
<p>Play it's so hard to talk when.</p>
<p>System in.</p>
<p>I have a skill 2.</p>
<p>Yes so again right I have it's the same thing.</p>
<p>Foregoing.</p>
<p>Not really bugs that caused by hardware.</p>
<p>Lines of code that are not working as intended.</p>
<p>I feel like i'm about to die.</p>
<p>Everybody.</p>
<p>Ok this is what i'm talking about.</p>
<p>Can I have another one like that so I can get my freaking battle pass and get out of here.</p>
<p>So why don't why don't you come back again ideal time to come back again soon.</p>
<p>Why don't you why would if you also think.</p>
<p>Is there a reason.</p>
<p>That would be a good time to do it because obviously in that one's going to be huge.</p>
<p>Rewards and stuff to do.</p>
<p>Where do I want to begin donna start with kokomi I don't want to start with a chain I have no idea because it felt like that worked out better for me last time.</p>
<p>Let's try this.</p>
<p>It's good to get to king's charger quite quickly to be fair.</p>
<p>What if I use the one cost or the two cast.</p>
<p>Where was this one.</p>
<p>Heal the tiger character for 1 hp I guess a good one actually.</p>
<p>Which characters for free though.</p>
<p>So since i've already got two hydrus and a thingy I should use this.</p>
<p>And then go ahead and switch straight over.</p>
<p>Although.</p>
<p>I could also do that and do another two and then kitchens.</p>
<p>Yeah also if you notice as well I don't know why.</p>
<p>Ok so first off it wants to run on now that makes sense that it would run ads in 1 minute and 30 seconds because we'll be at 3 hours of the stream so that's actually correct it should be running out to actually.</p>
<p>So what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>How much use that.</p>
<p>Did I do a be right back I don't remember doing a be right back to be honest I know it's changed games at some point.</p>
<p>5 seconds.</p>
<p>I'm not used.</p>
<p>I need to pair more elemental dice god damn it.</p>
<p>This is so annoying.</p>
<p>Elements.</p>
<p>Send a one last days so there's no reason not to give call to me that I guess but does it only apply to the current round.</p>
<p>If it does then there would be no point.</p>
<p>Yeah it's not really worth changing characters made around then really because it's just like it's too costly and by the time you do it you can't do anything is that new character anywhere.</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>I can find.</p>
<p>Yeah I swear now is saying.</p>
<p>Compile you know like that wears.</p>
<p>Where do we set it before though to be there he kind of play.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>Weird he just seem to be saying it differently now.</p>
<p>Which now shows up as pc boo I think.</p>
<p>Should shop like that.</p>
<p>Genshin.</p>
<p>You keep talking about project morgan and he says morgan.</p>
<p>Only just changed yesterday actually on my twitch page I still had a picture of a.</p>
<p>Saying she was the ai agent.</p>
<p>If there's anything else you guys.</p>
<p>Wished he pronounced differently now would be time speak up or forever hold your peace.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want any.</p>
<p>Pronunciation corrections because now would be the time.</p>
<p>Well yeah I can I can do that that's what I made that system for so what would you like him to call you.</p>
<p>Yeah you were in there at some point and I just took you out because I thought well we'll never see him again little did I know.</p>
<p>You would return.</p>
<p>Are you guys want to.</p>
<p>Type stuff in cv.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>What about you pick up.</p>
<p>I didn't hear him.</p>
<p>Silly.</p>
<p>So I could have him say something like.</p>
<p>Peak of the freaca that's a good one.</p>
<p>Put on if you know.</p>
<p>Yeah well I haven't changed play compile to cappy because.</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p>Play compile is the name of the.</p>
<p>Why is the name of the channel so he'll say welcome to the capy live stream which is ok but really it's the play compile live stream and I don't really have anywhere to separate.</p>
<p>The name the only way to do it would be if i.</p>
<p>The only way to do it would be to make another account and give myself a copy name twitch account.</p>
<p>Make me moderator of my own channel and then always do everything through that.</p>
<p>No I guess it's end of round.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Apparently with switching the.</p>
<p>Talk to me now for whatever reason what the f*** was that all about.</p>
<p>What even happened I don't even understand what happens did I already say a switch character at some point i'm so confused about what even happens.</p>
<p>Ok well let's drop a jellyfish and try and heal.</p>
<p>What are these do next time you perform switch character it will be a fast action.</p>
<p>Why is this what she called f****** blonde tits why is his blunted so strong.</p>
<p>Sing I can remember.</p>
<p>What do we do what are we doing what are we doing about a freaking die that's for about to do.</p>
<p>I need to end this once and for all I need to get cookies old up so I can start healing but I don't I won't survive another attack like that.</p>
<p>That's for sure.</p>
<p>So what do I do.</p>
<p>I mean everybody's on 32 and 3 hp so what do I even do.</p>
<p>I don't even know what I do.</p>
<p>What do I do guys.</p>
<p>I feel like i'm screwed.</p>
<p>Yeah it's stupid.</p>
<p>Is there too many of them.</p>
<p>Do you remember one or two so it was fine when it was just.</p>
<p>Chiang ling.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>It's getting hard to remember the mall.</p>
<p>Jimmy jimmy is better.</p>
<p>Jimmy.</p>
<p>I am scooty the way I don't even know what to do.</p>
<p>What do I do.</p>
<p>What else can I do i'm going to die either i'm definitely going to die.</p>
<p>I want to die.</p>
<p>It's fine there's two of mine and there's two of hers now one of mine is two and hers is 4 they both have massive attack buffs on them.</p>
<p>Search not great but.</p>
<p>I don't know maybe I could win maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do just got a kitchen.</p>
<p>Bye bye bich whatever your name is.</p>

<p>I don't care about double drops.</p>
<p>Is there anything else we can do for the battle pass.</p>
<p>We can't spend resin today because we're saving for the weapon.</p>
<p>Alicia's close to being like pokmon tcg I don't I never played it on.</p>
<p>I mean inspired by.</p>
<p>Beatbox opponents 10 times.</p>
<p>Cast energy we don't want to do that right.</p>

<p>I don't need to do layer lines I could pick it do you have.</p>
<p>An eu account for genshin.</p>
<p>Can I buy something from your teapot.</p>
<p>450 battle pass points.</p>
<p>If I can do that.</p>
<p>Outside of that there's nothing else I can really do what I suppose I could kill bosses and just not collect the mats.</p>
<p>This is so desperate.</p>
<p>Let me know when it's downloaded picker.</p>
<p>Let me know when it's downloaded because you need to you need to download it anywhere for that one.</p>
<p>You know i'm not on the.</p>

<p>I don't care if he's dad left him there's a reason he's dad left him because he will lose her.</p>
<p>Who's the murder ducks as well he used to hit that as well can murder a dock.</p>
<p>How did that survive.</p>
<p>Is it desperate.</p>
<p>Yes are we just absolutely so we'll start with the let's do like a let's do a tour of bosses and jean already version 1.0 we had.</p>
<p>The cryo whopper flower.</p>
<p>Will diwali b****.</p>
<p>She's got a level 20 weapon right now.</p>
<p>And what's your serial number.</p>
<p>What's your mum's credit card number.</p>
<p>No don't get the match we don't want the match ok so the short answer is.</p>
<p>He weak man we also have the cubes remember these cubes these cubes are pretty tragic bosses.</p>
<p>Does that mean there's no dendra hypothesis cube I don't think there's a dendra hypothesis cube because.</p>
<p>One no I don't think there is a dendro hypothesis cube is now.</p>
<p>And what do you think i'm going to do with that.</p>
<p>What use what use would that possibly have for me are memories yes I remember the sweet times playing version 4.8.0 on the score 2460 3909 on scott 248 22834 good times good times indeed.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Put me down your big boy.</p>
<p>You know what I think it is you know.</p>
<p>Is it really all the buses oh no we got the we got the electric cube on there was a go one as well wasn't the.</p>
<p>To be fair I did I have been fighting.</p>
<p>The animal cube because gene is one of my more recent five stars and I did final finalise her levelling up recently just cause.</p>
<p>But this one I don't know how long it's been since I thought this one I have no idea I didn't know what it does.</p>
<p>Ok stop posting stupid numbers.</p>
<p>Stop posting stupid numbers.</p>
<p>Unless you inviting me to the teapot.</p>
<p>Is that it.</p>
<p>I remember that year one being a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Where's the geo one.</p>
<p>Where the hell does the joker live.</p>
<p>I like this one.</p>
<p>You can have all level one characters that wouldn't affect me.</p>
<p>Did you do you have a teapot on that account.</p>
<p>Hi mum.</p>
<p>Oh my god look how weaker is now.</p>
<p>That's crazy our week that is now.</p>
<p>I struggled with this.</p>
<p>Ocean edge.</p>
<p>When was a real b**** when it first came out and the admitted right they bug fixed it they said what was happening is.</p>
<p>The weather so basically you get affected by weather in the skin like if it's raining or whatever.</p>
<p>And then they went and added a voice to it because it's not a voice originally this thing didn't talk originally.</p>
<p>So we've got what else do we got that in no that's samaroh that one.</p>
<p>Primo gov sharp yeah but I can't join you as your account can i.</p>
<p>Oh well let me start a new account then get to ar60 buy everything that I bought that isn't even available right now because there were limited time characters.</p>
<p>And get and get that but i'll pass off here.</p>
<p>And then everything will be fine then i'll be right in the same situation i.</p>
<p>Alright now this thing.</p>
<p>What's cool about this thing is it changes elements right so it looks like i've got the cryo version which I always thought was quite cool you never knew which version you were going to get is random.</p>
<p>I've been asked to help with this by the way.</p>
<p>Claire's genuinely struggle against this.</p>
<p>When it first came out.</p>
<p>Make by comparison I mean.</p>
<p>How many how many is that.</p>
<p>That's half of them.</p>
<p>Is this one the ocean is.</p>
<p>Ocean edge.</p>
<p>Cnn i've heard so many different pronunciations of this.</p>
<p>I think in game they do set or cnn.</p>
<p>Pink.</p>
<p>I just realised i've got the wrong team for this.</p>
<p>This is easy as hell.</p>
<p>Can you is.</p>
<p>Such a game changer for this boss.</p>
<p>Take a ship these nuts.</p>
<p>Who are you calling at b**** I am et.</p>
<p>Keep calls.</p>
<p>Who's the kid called in et.</p>
<p>Film like.</p>
<p>Elliot ellie.</p>
<p>Elliot that's it.</p>
<p>Give can you some help.</p>
<p>When is the first boss i've had to heal against to be fair.</p>
<p>Shut up b****.</p>
<p>You talk too much.</p>
<p>Well you didn't last very long did you.</p>
<p>Should I put the kettle on.</p>
<p>Genshin bosses.</p>
<p>Yep just want to talk about gio gio hypercube geo hypothesis cube.</p>
<p>Like say you fake payroll registering right you wouldn't take thyroid cause it be immune of hierarch so the geo hypercubus can a unique in a way because you can't do it properly without a geo character.</p>
<p>So instead of geo being immune.</p>
<p>Gios kind of essential actually.</p>
<p>See my seasons related to jesse pinkman that's why she says bich at the end.</p>
<p>Farina.</p>
<p>Is crazy or easy to move this game.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think I can try to remember how this works.</p>
<p>My healing is not instantaneous anymore either.</p>
<p>Ok I could use farinas healing as well just to make sure that.</p>
<p>You still alive.</p>
<p>It moves around all of this thing though.</p>
<p>It's kind of hard to tell what's.</p>
<p>I can't tell what my attacks are and what it's attacks are.</p>
<p>Add to destroy these rock pillars.</p>
<p>Ok yes very gimmicky.</p>
<p>What I was a fan of gimmicky boss is it depends what the gimmick is and if the gimmicks on.</p>
<p>Can you freeze to death as well so you've got a you got a train stick lost to a.</p>
<p>Mechanic.</p>
<p>But they give you these little pillars that you have to keep running towards to not freeze to death now to be fair i'm probably so strong at this point that i'll just kill it way before that even is an issue.</p>
<p>Put back back in the day.</p>
<p>Back in the pre cooking ideas you know when barbara was your only healer and barbara would f****** get you wet.</p>
<p>As well.</p>
<p>Yesterday these are what you have to do.</p>
<p>In spanish on that.</p>
<p>And some pokmon as well I think.</p>
<p>I remember this.</p>
<p>Snowballs I remember this this is actually coolest f*** you have to charge attack the snowballs back at the will she not do it.</p>
<p>You have to charge attack the snowballs back at the thing and break it's shield this is actually cool.</p>
<p>Yeah I like this.</p>
<p>Did you see where do I cried.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I did react to it but I don't remember him crying.</p>
<p>I almost died.</p>
<p>What's the hall lightstream but I watched most of the live stream I think I stopped watching it when.</p>
<p>So yeah it might be like I don't know.</p>
<p>I might need to take another look at it right so that would be 8 of 10.</p>
<p>Ok 9:10.</p>
<p>9 of 10 we're outside of dragon spine so next oh.</p>
<p>Write any bosses and antonym.</p>
<p>The next was economy.</p>
<p>Yeah they said something about you can fast track to areas and stuff now.</p>
<p>Characters.</p>
<p>I wouldn't do if I were you I would I would go through and clear everything in order because it's just going to be better that way.</p>
<p>Make more sense as well.</p>
<p>Search a long time.</p>
<p>Fair amount.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Destroy the wall I can remember this.</p>
<p>Where's purple boy.</p>
<p>Isaac on the wall can I destroy that one as well.</p>
<p>I need to kill these together I think.</p>
<p>What achievements.</p>
<p>Defeat the herd without allowing them to dive into the water.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess I wouldn't have been strong enough to do that before.</p>
<p>Cos I didn't I didn't I can do that for a while cos sometimes you miss these little hints the pop-up during the during the thing.</p>
<p>Could I send.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Where's siri.</p>
<p>Did they delete sarai.</p>
<p>It was during ok no I would be in a zoomer next to be fair.</p>
<p>What's the right was ok yeah so in a zoomer was weird.</p>
<p>So I think we got all four islands for start at least by the time I started playing.</p>
<p>Open world.</p>
<p>Like there's no rush to get I think you know in fact this is the thing i'd be jealous of you because he is the thing right I was reflecting on this the other day.</p>
<p>I loved I loved monster and I love leeway and I love dragon spine and I played all of those as they released right but there that's because monster and lee were released all at once right and then dragon spine got added as a small area all at once but then because players were complaining that it was taken too long to get patches.</p>
<p>Part of inazuma they started.</p>
<p>Seeing these updates to us right so we got inazuma.</p>
<p>I think we got more stuff in a zoomer though to be felt like I said I think they gave us part one was those four islands which is a f***** on.</p>
<p>And then part 2 was sir.</p>
<p>And I took my time within azuma.</p>
<p>I got sarai before I completely.</p>
<p>For islands and then you know.</p>
<p>So keep me busy and it kept me like a lot to do and I think that's why I enjoyed in a zoom so much then I took another break from genshin before samaro came out and buy the time I went to samaru.</p>
<p>Most of it had already released.</p>
<p>I remember about.</p>
<p>And literally like 2 or 3 days in the samaroh that dropped in that became available so I had all of samara to explore as well.</p>
<p>When fontaine came out.</p>
<p>I play that was the first region I played as it released.</p>
<p>And I felt like it was quite lackluster I remember constantly thinking is this it.</p>
<p>Is kept thinking is this it now looking back now I think it's because it got.</p>
<p>And I think that kind of ruins it to be honest I feel like it feels.</p>
<p>I feel like if I have waited until now and then done all of fontaines in one swoop.</p>
<p>I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily think is this is that is that it I would probably think oh well there's quite a lot yeah this is cool so I genuinely think that the peace mailing of regions kind of ruins it.</p>
<p>It's much better if you just wait for it all.</p>
<p>Can you explore all at once.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>I'm kind of jealous I can't really do that now because.</p>
<p>I want the characters so the characters are going to need mats from the area so because I want the characters on release and i'm like you know I am going to have to play as it releases essentially but if I was in your shoes I would definitely do that I would take your time.</p>
<p>50 but like you know it is what it is.</p>
<p>You win some you lose some right.</p>
<p>Read any reason to stop playing again.</p>
<p>Weekly bosses.</p>
<p>What's in fact you want to know something I can't I feel like.</p>
<p>Resume camera I got a during a rerun.</p>
<p>The characters I got during in a zoomers run.</p>
<p>Was yumiko.</p>
<p>Unexpected.</p>
<p>I think that's it yeah basically that's actually kind of crazy so for all of inazuma the only two characters I got during in a zoom as time and he's the weird thing about that.</p>
<p>Yamika who wasn't even it was just like a you know let's see if I can get her but I you know I probably won't and actually did even though she wasn't even jewish but it's complete outside of p.</p>
<p>No I don't think so i'm pretty sure I can call me was during the dry spell cuz players were desperate for something to do don't you remember we're waiting for inazuma f****** forever.</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Is that the thing that you dive down in a year.</p>
<p>Impact for ff14 for so long then.</p>
<p>Because we had nothing after f******.</p>
<p>What's a dragon spine.</p>
<p>Until freaking in a zoomer.</p>
<p>So I get I get why they split.</p>
<p>I get why they split the regions of.</p>
<p>How long arsons fontaine drops.</p>
<p>But it's the same time it does come with a cost and that I think the individual pieces feel a little lackluster.</p>
<p>On the run.</p>
<p>Buy comparison but.</p>
<p>What are you doing I don't want to climb that.</p>
<p>That was my 10 bosses ok but i'm having fun doing this so i'm going to go and do.</p>
<p>Who does the thing at the bottom of the thing right.</p>
<p>Yes that's crazy so the whole of inner zoom is time yeah that makes sense as well right because I wasn't playing the game no that makes sense and here's the thing about kokomi as well I failed the 50/50 so he's what happened to me during inazuma I got yummy call completely outside of pity.</p>
<p>I said I was hyped as f***.</p>
<p>Was any person who I felt like I was the only person who was I preformed for her I was so hyped for a finally I get to replace barbara another healer I can't wait.</p>
<p>Roll the 50/50.</p>
<p>Add to swipe hard to get cockney.</p>
<p>Sing I got from in a zoom was just the gems I got from playing in azuma so I guess that that makes sense why I got a lot less characters for in a zoomer because.</p>
<p>Add stop playing and I wasn't I was no longer earning gems right.</p>
<p>And I won both 50/50 so I got lucky cos again i'd stopped playing before samara see i've gotten a lot i've gotten a lot more stuff during fontaine because i've continued playing for the most part during fontaine so during fontaine i've managed to get.</p>
<p>Set another constellation on neelu.</p>
<p>Are managed to get.</p>
<p>C1.</p>
<p>Adrian I got c1 farina.</p>
<p>It's insane I got so much during fontan.</p>
<p>Ask fine I believe I believe you.</p>
<p>I can test it by jumping in a lot like you sir you probably right because you got somewhere when you jump into that well right it's just not how my memory remembers it that's all.</p>
<p>It's crazy how much easier everything is now.</p>
<p>Crazy.</p>
<p>Unusual.</p>
<p>I wasn't even really able to clear spiral burst until I got.</p>
<p>Yeah the characters are like I put a lot of investment in.</p>
<p>And also she's missing.</p>
<p>Yes I need to get that outfit for actually.</p>
<p>Something i'll do that.</p>
<p>With a level 20 weapon have you seen the damage she does.</p>
<p>Yeah with my favourite characters I do I do build after build after build.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>My 4th of 5th sea twin build.</p>
<p>Cos I tried I tried everything I was like okay let's.</p>
<p>How do I want to be and I try different things.</p>
<p>Until i'm happy with everything energy damage healing and make sure everything is exactly the way I wanted to be.</p>
<p>My cookie jesus was I really do it depends in this game I fuss over my heels cos he'll is.</p>
<p>How does a carnival when I when cooking me became a.</p>
<p>Stinky bloom character.</p>
<p>Yes I kind of unbuilt talk to me.</p>
<p>Like perfected.</p>
<p>As a healer as a dbs / healer.</p>
<p>Fana zuma.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I need a second call gummi build that's good at a.m..</p>
<p>Because that's what this team really wants.</p>
<p>Well what's weird ok so the first the first time I left genshin.</p>
<p>Have you really quit the game twice I wouldn't say quit the game.</p>
<p>I desperately want.</p>
<p>And during that time in azuma came out but I just carried on playing after 14 I thought ok i'll come back again but also during that time they had please summer event.</p>
<p>And I knew I was going to go and get my clay.</p>
<p>So I came back specifically it do please summer event during that break and i'm not in you I like the f****** time of my life that might be my best time ever engaged you actually was so.</p>
<p>So like I was it was so good to come back to the game like it's not like i've left genshin because I was mad at it I didn't want to play it until I it was the opposite I wanted stuff to do and there was nothing to do so when I was finally something to do it was just so f****** good and having my brand new clear was just so fun.</p>
<p>I had a lot to do.</p>
<p>But the second time I left.</p>
<p>Genshin was that time like more recently when I was streaming.</p>
<p>And I was yeah I was just kind of.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of.</p>
<p>I think what it was mainly I think I think the man cutlass was you know the whole community was kind of pissed off with the game felt like developed was worth listening.</p>
<p>The anniversary awards.</p>
<p>Having that confirmed.</p>
<p>It's not like they ever said that it was going to be anything else.</p>
<p>But you can see especially somebody plays a lot of games right like.</p>
<p>Let's set the engine community obviously play a lot of games these are like gamers people who really care about these games not just like casuals who played very casually.</p>
<p>Do you recognise these games systems we recognise.</p>
<p>Installations we recognise xp levelling systems you know.</p>
<p>Lake legendary weapons we could see that this game was looking like.</p>
<p>We were.</p>
<p>You know I think I think that I think the harder car community could easily see that this game was designed to be another honkai impact 3rd.</p>
<p>Another another sweaty you know with some real challenging content and you know whatever and some endgame and everything else.</p>
<p>And I think that probably was what this game was originally going to be.</p>
<p>But then because the game because of covid the game was so insanely successful and the analytics showed that the majority of players were very very casual and didn't even bother with spiral the best that significantly had to change the course of direction to the game I think.</p>
<p>Which makes sense but I was like I was mad because I thought well you could at least f****** you know do.</p>
<p>Play the playlist something which is that imaginary in theatre.</p>
<p>Answer before some america came out I was genuinely kind of just pissed off with the game and just thought I might at the game.</p>
<p>But then I don't know like I came back to samaro.</p>
<p>Like so I need to just like except that it's not going to be what I wanted to be and I need to play this game knowing what it actually is.</p>
<p>And so I just like I just really kind of I just kind of read I don't know i'll configured my brand or whatever to say ok so we're not going to play this like a sweaty online game.</p>
<p>We're gonna play casually.</p>
<p>I suddenly started you know loving the game for what it is.</p>
<p>I mean i've already done i've already done the thing.</p>
<p>Is that all of the meaning of zuma.</p>
<p>On dear site of farm the s*** out of this f****** me.</p>
<p>I barely remember this a lot of with a lot of these all the bosses the only reason I was familiar with them as I am.</p>
<p>I thought them in there.</p>
<p>Environments like this in so long some of them this one especially.</p>
<p>Who is this phone for.</p>
<p>I think there might be a bit of power creep.</p>
<p>Defeat the third manifestation without being a hit.</p>
<p>Yeah and that's.</p>
<p>Let me try to think where it is.</p>
<p>It's a big pool you can dive in now.</p>
<p>You played female mc.</p>
<p>I never played mc.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I remember now you drop down.</p>
<p>A belly fish in this game I have fishing.</p>
<p>My mind does the gap because I took the big broke from the game and.</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>I felt like the day and nights thing mechanic that they did was a little on the undercut.</p>
<p>But now that now that I remember that this was added at the end of inside.</p>
<p>Nothing to do.</p>
<p>I can't leave you still holding on to a 50.</p>
<p>Yes so that means this game had nothing to do for the longest amount of time and then inazuma enkanomiya and cleese adventure we're all kind of around the same time.</p>
<p>And it's like where you like basically released.</p>
<p>An insane amount of content all I want.</p>
<p>So then why didn't ok let me ask you this then so why didn't you ever get mad at tara fantasy for losing a 50/50 and then leaves tower of fantasy.</p>
<p>I know you left tariff fantasy for health reasons but why because I assume you must have won you must have lost plenty of 50/50.</p>
<p>Are you swiped and got her and then you quit the game.</p>
<p>That's so weird to me.</p>
<p>Does economy have I already thought the boss tonight as the dragons ok so we don't need to be in here.</p>
<p>Everything from.</p>
<p>But you still talk about you said something like genshin brings back such fun memories but also already but mary of when I lost that 50/50 as if i.</p>
<p>Kitchen wrong during somewhere by losing the 50/50.</p>
<p>It just seems like you.</p>
<p>Bedroom light and then even we didn't like it says if I remember correctly I seem to remember you saying that you swiped and got her anywhere but then you quit which is even strange to me.</p>
<p>Can you understand.</p>
<p>You feel like you can't quit it because.</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>
<p>Yeah I still got some.</p>
<p>That'll be a different day I guess.</p>
<p>Is bruce still showing up by the way.</p>
<p>Nice disappeared.</p>
<p>To make a star on out.</p>
<p>What was the first game of played.</p>
<p>Can you show while I was still planet.</p>
<p>Keep talking for me.</p>
<p>Strange.</p>
<p>Very strange.</p>
<p>3 pools gone.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You know what I might do this is actually really good idea.</p>
<p>If I set up my rbs.</p>
<p>Let's do this actually what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy my normal.</p>
<p>Will duplicate my normal.</p>
<p>Call it debug.</p>
<p>Call uni.</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification.</p>
<p>Version.</p>
<p>Good enough.</p>
<p>Why is pigs green.</p>
<p>Take screen colour.</p>
<p>Chronic he must be too aggressive.</p>
<p>Ok that should give us.</p>
<p>Version.</p>
<p>Why the f*** would you do that.</p>
<p>Are rbs why would you do that I click the windows that I can thank you.</p>
<p>And you guys still get a you know.</p>
<p>Closest thing to a normal stream.</p>
<p>Is because i'm minimised unity.</p>
<p>Nokia well that's fine I guess.</p>
<p>So I can't do it anymore.</p>
<p>So this ends today is the last one.</p>
<p>To put these together.</p>
<p>But it feels so inconsequential as a player.</p>
<p>What do you want.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>Why do I always end up with freaking billy.</p>
<p>I haven't even.</p>
<p>I haven't even got a single copy of corin on this banner do you know that.</p>
<p>Now to be fair i've already got a c6.</p>
<p>No I actually don't i've already got a c4 so I could have done with a couple more copies of her cuz she's actually quite good.</p>
<p>I don't like billy I don't like the guns that's why I didn't get the other cup.</p>
<p>I don't like the guns in the scam.</p>
<p>Am I using billy's thing.</p>
<p>What is.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Give me something good today.</p>
<p>Can I have something good today.</p>
<p>Cancel.</p>
<p>Gibson's screw you.</p>
<p>Screw you n word that's what it says.</p>
<p>Do you manager thanks to your help my playback device is not working perfectly the image is much clearer when we watch video tapes well whoop the freaking do.</p>
<p>What's the deal with that white shadow.</p>
<p>White shadow ark and I watch the videos from that day several times but we couldn't find any white shadows at all nothing much is the colour not even the curtains.</p>
<p>You got white curtains wanna be really bright.</p>
<p>Black curtains yeah cuz you want to keep the sun out.</p>
<p>Tell archie accidentally turned the ricardo around capturing both of you have probably got white curtains and you probably.</p>
<p>If you enjoy it then that's fine but.</p>
<p>The white shadow was behind her.</p>

<p>Before I pick up the headphones.</p>
<p>Sing fluffy it's sad.</p>
<p>I don't want to know right ok can we get the reward for that please.</p>
<p>And what do we need for our lovely lovely miku she is a greedy little maker.</p>
<p>Who wants so adventurous you know that.</p>
<p>Should be a cheap date that I wouldn't see the that's what I like to hear.</p>
<p>Miguel you look lovely tonight can I take you somewhere nice maybe you know go for some pasta or some I don't know.</p>
<p>Carrier no just hot water for me thank you i'll put the kettle on.</p>
<p>Ideal ideal girl she's always going to be putting that kettle on.</p>
<p>Not getting drunk.</p>
<p>What about an expensive drinks.</p>
<p>I mean it cost money to hit the water though to be fair.</p>
<p>How much is solar.</p>
<p>I don't think so.</p>
<p>Is sorrento we got a three purple and three blue three blue makes a purple so since you've got four purple mummies we need.</p>
<p>Something for the battle pass.</p>
<p>Nothing spectacular.</p>
<p>I miss you.</p>
<p>How many more you need this is.</p>
<p>Just now.</p>
<p>You still need 7 more are you actually taking a piss.</p>
<p>With all that hot water you drank so much hot water and I was taking the piss out here.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Even more.</p>
<p>How much energy do we have.</p>
<p>If I had 60.</p>
<p>I will go out on public record and say.</p>
<p>Never has.</p>
<p>The match that I need.</p>
<p>Except the one time that I say anything he's got drop right off so let's go we're going to get this one time.</p>
<p>Where to get it for one.</p>
<p>One batch.</p>
<p>Should we just do the same again.</p>
<p>60 and it is worth let's try 40 just see what we get I don't know all the farmers.</p>
<p>Battery juices sore.</p>
<p>It's so hard in the scam right now it's like I don't think it's going to be enough but I just don't have a farm so we'll just see what this does with a double drop on one of them you never know it might add up cuz essentially that's the equivalent of 3 runs right.</p>
<p>So maybe it will be enough.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to push that with a.</p>
<p>A different body parts that's because I don't know i'm supposed to have enough thumbs left to do that it's been the way I play as well maybe I don't know.</p>
<p>Torch.</p>
<p>Very difficult.</p>
<p>Maybe left mouse button is dodge.</p>
<p>So what's attack on keyboard.</p>
<p>F maybe.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's possible on controller honestly.</p>
<p>I mean you can do it if you stop.</p>
<p>Do you have to take you have to take you have to stop doing the thing.</p>
<p>This is jokes actual joke.</p>
<p>Oh my god she's still needs for what did I get three.</p>
<p>With a double drops like a three that sucks.</p>
<p>So essentially for every 20 energy.</p>
<p>Thereabouts that I spend I get one of these f******.</p>
<p>So I would essentially have to spend 80 more energy.</p>
<p>Even 60 seems a bit much to be honest.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<p>Me too I like this.</p>
<p>Do you know what I should be arrested.</p>
<p>Eat so many maths right.</p>
<p>Ok I kind of did it.</p>
<p>You can't do it without interrupting her.</p>
<p>What do you call it.</p>
<p>Play people are sent online but you with keyboard and mouse maybe you can but not on control account.</p>
<p>If I get an extra if elan can give me an extra thumb.</p>
<p>Am I right hand we might get the manager.</p>
<p>Would you be allowed to compete in esports tournaments if you had an additional dumb installed.</p>
<p>Would they let me compete in esports times today.</p>
<p>I bet it's.</p>
<p>It's a loophole is what it is.</p>
<p>That was exactly what we need.</p>
<p>That was pain pure pain and I still don't have enough money.</p>
<p>Play 40 not 400 k.</p>
<p>I haven't even got 200 ok how much can we get.</p>
<p>Let's start by going to scott outpost.</p>
<p>Cuz I did some farming last night.</p>
<p>Coinage things.</p>
<p>This is so harsh.</p>
<p>Get bailey.</p>
<p>Two.</p>
<p>Is there anything get money from.</p>
<p>I mean does the store right.</p>
<p>I'm allowed to buy 12 more.</p>
<p>Listening 9 more in stock.</p>
<p>I have to buy ok that was 54 grand national.</p>
<p>And actually I run out of the currency.</p>
<p>Go to the next page oh yes sorry everything was.</p>
<p>How much money everything is going to be like.</p>
<p>Cheaper now.</p>
<p>And f*** you everybody you already.</p>
<p>What they should do.</p>
<p>I would support them in that decision if they said ok you everything was too expensive and for every danny you spent above what it now costs we're going to give you 103 paws.</p>
<p>Are you f****** kidding me.</p>
<p>I had to spend.</p>
<p>I had to spend god knows how much energy in some cases spend real money on battle pass batteries.</p>
<p>And other players are just going to get it cheaper for free now because it does suck.</p>
<p>I think if they just give you the money back.</p>
<p>Refund you like the extra that you spent.</p>
<p>It just in the stupid and getting money.</p>
<p>I think that's the least they should do if if they were to do that.</p>
<p>You can say ok well I guess I don't have to farm money for a while.</p>
<p>So I get something out of it.</p>
<p>Easy right now.</p>
<p>Are you for sure.</p>
<p>You don't even have a spine boo you're spineless collection of mesh.</p>
<p>In digital 1000 you don't even know what the f*** you talking about.</p>
<p>I still need money.</p>
<p>The belly dented it.</p>
<p>Do you see how that belly dented it.</p>
<p>My I just emptied all of my.</p>
<p>Gacha currency.</p>
<p>What's the currency and all of my rewards for endgame in a currency.</p>
<p>I still need 155 g.</p>
<p>Yeah this kind of sucks.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>I want to feel mad I want to get I want to get riled up let's get rid of.</p>
<p>Yeah tell me about it tell me about it.</p>
<p>If you tell me to buy it from the shop.</p>
<p>Can you tell me how to get the money please.</p>
<p>Tell me then.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>You could have just said hi guys do weekly bosses thanks for watching bye.</p>
<p>I didn't know weekly bosses also gave money this is good advice this good advice is good advice i've done one of three I think i've got two left.</p>
<p>Is it good advice.</p>
<p>Yeah I got two left.</p>
<p>What do I need to I need these for me girl.</p>
<p>3 g that ain't s***.</p>
<p>There's no way we're going to get 3 grand.</p>
<p>Hopefully that's like 3000 of like $100,000 each or something so we get like 3 ml or something like actually significant because three grand day going to do s*** for me.</p>
<p>Alright let's get it done.</p>
<p>Nice narnia.</p>
<p>Realistic.</p>
<p>Officer greedy.</p>
<p>Stick office ingredients slot 1 let's go.</p>
<p>We are in.</p>
<p>We're not very well stocked right now.</p>
<p>I like I like buffing my bangla I think it's funny.</p>
<p>Why should I wash my make.</p>
<p>Are you little s***.</p>
<p>I mean make sense of like 24 hours.</p>
<p>5 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Piss off.</p>
<p>Rotation I guess.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Getting chewed up by him.</p>
<p>Oh my god you suck.</p>
<p>I suck.</p>
<p>I lost my girl.</p>
<p>On itunes.</p>
<p>Maybe they come back to life.</p>
<p>This is such a f****** b**** I hate these f****** building enemies I hate this whole theme in the game I already do.</p>
<p>Nobody's fully built yet.</p>
<p>So my team's going to get stronger and as long as it doesn't get any stronger and if anything it might even get enough at some point.</p>
<p>As long as as long as it doesn't get any stronger than clear this is going to get easier.</p>
<p>Right now it's such a f****** b**** 7 minutes and 19 seconds of f****** b*******.</p>
<p>And it still says there's no way I want to give me 3000 denny's right is this guy taking the piss in this video.</p>
<p>3000 denny's doesn't do s***.</p>
<p>5000 will stephen.</p>
<p>What's 7000.</p>
<p>Ok see you get.</p>
<p>Is that 10 grand you.</p>
<p>An extra 5 grand for doing it in under 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Because i'm a f****** will.</p>
<p>An extra 10 grand for doing it all over 4 minutes again there's no way i'd have to be a f****** well to do that.</p>
<p>How much she costs.</p>
<p>Surely please tell me a joke and that's a f****** pissed take if it is.</p>
<p>Oh my god it literally is.</p>
<p>Like that's f*** all I need 400 grand.</p>
<p>To do a ascension and doing that gave me I think what was it 2000 + 5000 or something so like 7 grand like are you f****** kidding me that's like.</p>
<p>That barely even touches it.</p>
<p>This is his amazing advice.</p>
<p>What's he f****** levelling f****** level 1 characters.</p>
<p>That is not a good source for f****** money if that's a good source for money f****** good album.</p>
<p>Like I don't even think it's worth it like 7 7 minutes that I really did not enjoy that fight because it's just like it's kind of f****** rough right now.</p>
<p>And even if I get the 10 grand for doing it three times this week right which I know I will at some point but even if I had that right now that's only going to put it to 263000.</p>
<p>A $400,000.</p>
<p>Is belly f****** worth it.</p>
<p>Julie that can't be his whole advice.</p>
<p>Yeah that's true you can get money with these.</p>
<p>To be fair.</p>
<p>How much.</p>
<p>Can you can get money with those actually.</p>
<p>Turn down to five grand packs for 20.</p>
<p>That was 40 grand.</p>
<p>So yeah I guess it helps because another one will be another 80 or bring it to 80 grand.</p>
<p>Oh my god that's rough.</p>
<p>That is rough.</p>
<p>I also disagree with his tick on oh you don't want to buy these out the shop because you want as many bangles as you can get blah blah my f****** bang booze at c3.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>That's so true.</p>
<p>Yeah I also disagree with this idea that like oh don't ever spend your your currency in the shop because there's always better things to buy it's like yeah but at the end of the day right.</p>
<p>If the games come down to a point where.</p>
<p>You're being time get it by the energy system.</p>
<p>Because the only other way to get it is through energy and you just want to level something up like you just need this resource right then obviously it makes sense to get that resource because at the end of the day this is always going to flow in so like you know what I mean you can just catch up on these other resources it's fine and they're probably not a priority for you right now like the priority for right now for me right now is to get her freaking built.</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>Make it a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Save everything don't spend the thing.</p>
<p>So if that's the thing stop me from making progress.</p>
<p>And you desperately need to I don't know hit some next milestone then obviously it makes sense to just spend it.</p>
<p>I haven't even hit 300.</p>
<p>Let me see what what does that give me again.</p>
<p>Like 40 I think I got.</p>
<p>I think I got 40k from him.</p>
<p>I get 10 grand for doing it a third time.</p>
<p>50 grand.</p>
<p>I think best case scenario that might have been a couple of extra awards in there for like 5 or 10 grand so best case scenario I think we're looking at 60 grand let's say.</p>
<p>Completing that.</p>
<p>It's still not going to be enough but.</p>
<p>By then we should be just under 360 farm right.</p>
<p>Which is better than wear right now which is over 100 g left of farm.</p>
<p>Yeah I think denny's in the scammers.</p>
<p>A bit harsh but I don't know I seem to remember i'm pretty sure this is how old how your games are when you first start playing them you always think it's going to be a problem and then you know once I mean think about it i've just i've had the level in all fairness so since the game came out the game if you think about it the games being out for just over a month.</p>
<p>I've levels and you never do this at any of the point in the game.</p>
<p>I've levels.</p>
<p>Which characters in that time.</p>
<p>Because I started level I started levelling karen.</p>
<p>Are you after levelling and be the 57 so I have to start again so it's like yeah i've literally levels.</p>
<p>8 characters.</p>
<p>Nearly all the way to the end.</p>
<p>In the space of what like just over a month which you never do in the game normally right because you nobody gets 8 new f****** characters in one month that doesn't happen.</p>
<p>I think it's balanced.</p>
<p>Normal schedule.</p>
<p>Cast character ascension.</p>
<p>Things can start to settle down or where they need to be.</p>
<p>That's pretty rough.</p>
<p>That was pretty rough.</p>
<p>My second five star was a weapon.</p>
<p>I couldn't use anyone and my third five star was deluke how insane is that so my four five star is daniel one that I actually wanted to build and run so obviously i've been playing again by 3 months at that point so I had 3 months worth of resources essentially served up so can you install a pen because I still like to get her specific mats but like outside of that I was pretty good and actually I managed to get like daniel and kaching around about the same time as each other but even that is only like ok you're building two five stars at once and you've been playing the game for 3 months you've got 3 months of mudd saved up so it really wasn't too bad but like star oil comes out and i'm building like f****** I don't know 45 characters at once this games come out and it's insane like I said i've built 8 characters at once which is a f****** insane amount of characters to build all at once it's.</p>
<p>And it's probably.</p>
<p>So yeah I guess it's no wonder it feels rough right now because like.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>What is left to do.</p>
<p>I don't know actually cuz there's only a little bit left to do on this and i'm pretty much out stuff to do so I might just.</p>
<p>Back on tomorrow.</p>
<p>But thank you for joining me and yeah i'll be back.</p>
