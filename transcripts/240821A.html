<h3>From Live stream on Wednesday 21-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LB3nnK0Y-E​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LB3nnK0Y-E​</a></h3>
<p>Is that ok.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>Talk to me.</p>
<p>I'll turn it down now.</p>
<p>I'm also going to need a new unity project in a second.</p>
<p>Apologies to anybody who is still watching ads you can't hear me right now anyway so.</p>
<p>I apologise to you in spirit.</p>
<p>Is probably nobody is probably nobody watching us right now.</p>
<p>Still I just want to get on so i'm just i'm not going to sit and wait for the adds to finish.</p>
<p>I know it's very naughty of me so what we need to do is we need to find out why booze hiding.</p>
<p>So i'm running this in debug.</p>
<p>So that's that's number one.</p>
<p>On the agenda for today.</p>
<p>Number two.</p>
<p>If I don't choke on my own phlegm morning phlegm delicious number two on the agenda is I made a little adjustments to our little pc boo.</p>
<p>Show you what I did.</p>
<p>I'm basically what he does.</p>
<p>What he now does.</p>
<p>What he now does is he saves a file.</p>
<p>Call transcripts.</p>
<p>And everything that comes up.</p>
<p>Underneath my tv that is speech to text.</p>
<p>Everything that speaks to text he is.</p>
<p>Play the way google do this to advertise to you.</p>
<p>They say they don't but I have proof that they do.</p>
<p>Will the proof that they do is that's exactly what i'm using to do this i'm using google chrome to do this.</p>
<p>That's why I have to open.</p>
<p>Google chrome speech.</p>
<p>Good morning and a copy of google chrome serving on localhost port 5000 because we're using built-in chrome voice recognition to process all of this so they say they're not listening to you but that's what's a box.</p>
<p>Certainly are why else would they have speech.</p>
<p>Ok so basically everything that I say now goes into a transcript txt so essentially I have.</p>
<p>A roof copy because we all know how accurate it's not.</p>
<p>Certain things that.</p>
<p>Dynamic html web pages.</p>
<p>Built in unity.</p>
<p>There you go straight away those words those phrases are now in a transcript we're going to put them into the website.</p>
<p>Why was two reasons.</p>
<p>Search engines love lots of text on websites because they think there's a lot of information on this website this must be a good website is that a little bit naughty maybe maybe you could you could say we're sort of.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of of.</p>
<p>Next invisible and then just fill the web page with walls of invisible text specifically to fool seos.</p>
<p>But instead what i've done is i've put together a transcript on the play compile.</p>
<p>What is which shows everything.</p>
<p>I said during the stream.</p>
<p>Allegedly.</p>
<p>What would be the point in this.</p>
<p>There are several reasons but the main reason is.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something specifically.</p>
<p>This this is my way of thinking if you're looking for something specifically let's see you watched a play compile stream.</p>
<p>Can you can't remember it when it was but you seem to remember vaguely you were like oh my god play compile mentioned this i've run into a problem in uni with web builds not supporting hdrp let's say right oh man and he he mentioned this at some point I can't remember which stream it was he showed you how to I remember it he showed you how to change the pipeline he showed you how to disable broccoli compression and i've completely forgotten which stream it was and let's say it wasn't a stream dedicated to that specific topic let's just say we came across it while we're doing one of the mini games or something like that right one of the genshin mini games will now well when I have the search functionality at least.</p>
<p>I'm giving the website something to search.</p>
<p>Which is everything i've ever said during a stream.</p>
<p>And we already have two full transcripts from twofold streams.</p>
<p>Play we're going to streamline this process.</p>
<p>So at the moment what I did is I generated a python script which basically capitalises the first letter of the transcript so if we're going to the transcripts.</p>
<p>It's all in law case right cos it's what comes up underneath the tv.</p>
<p>So what I say is all in love ok so it doesn't look very good it doesn't look like sensors.</p>
<p>So what the python scripts are.</p>
<p>Siren python transcribe.com.</p>
<p>They got conversion complet.</p>
<p>Html content saved so if we go into our dump now you'll see a new file called output dot html.</p>
<p>What that output html has done is it's taken our transcribe.</p>
<p>And it's capitalised the first letter and put each line into its own paragraph.</p>
<p>So here's what you should do whenever if ever you need to process a lot of data like this right here's the first thing you should do right is if you are also made a process right this is great for automating process as well.</p>
<p>Can you find cos i'm still I was still figuring.</p>
<p>So let's go through what we do.</p>
<p>At the moment.</p>
<p>Set the moment we run a python script and then we need to break down what that python script does right so the python script.</p>
<p>Capitalises.</p>
<p>Every first letter.</p>
<p>Add full stop at the end.</p>
<p>It also.</p>
<p>Put.</p>
<p>P and.</p>
<p>Pause p tags.</p>
<p>Alarm html.</p>
<p>Our new unity program what i'm going to do is i'm going to.</p>
<p>At the end of the day at the end of the stream it's going to take the transcript it's going to do everything the python script does it's going to do everything that I then do manually.</p>
<p>Ok so let's call this manual labour so after that I do some manual labour.</p>
<p>Html so let me talk you through this is great just go through the process the first thing you should do is just go through the process yourself and i'm record every step that you do.</p>
<p>Html so the next thing I would do is I would do a search and replace.</p>
<p>Ok and I do a space I because every time I mention myself like that it looks weird.</p>
<p>So we know that space I space should be capitalised so.</p>
<p>How do I replace all so let's add that to the list of things that the script needs to do right so then we replace.</p>
<p>Then I paste.</p>
<p>Header html.</p>
<p>The top of the page.</p>
<p>Ok I pierced footer html at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>And then I replace.</p>
<p>And add the streams.</p>
<p>Youtube link to the transcript.</p>
<p>All we need to do so right let's let's make a new project.</p>
<p>When will call it.</p>
<p>Which is what our python script was called because that's exactly what it's going to do and it would help if I could spell it correctly and they've got transcribe so going to make a project called transcribe.</p>
<p>So a lot of web.</p>
<p>Site building is.</p>
<p>Getting individual pieces and elements are right getting them to work properly.</p>
<p>Fitting them together.</p>
<p>Until you have like a kind of template once you've got a template everything becomes easier after that point unless you're using something like wordpress then a lot of your template type stuff is handled by php in themes but because we're hosting on github.</p>
<p>Pages what are all these.</p>
<p>Requests.</p>
<p>Ok so we now have a new project called transcribe ok.</p>
<p>So here's what we do.</p>
<p>Here's what we do.</p>
<p>Anything we lord locally to the project ok.</p>
<p>Anything we load in locally to the project will come from this folder here and we can test this.</p>
<p>Ok it's going to be in the projects route folder by default.</p>
<p>How far do we want to place a few things in fact so you've got we've got an asset although I tend to use.</p>
<p>Yeah ok whenever I do to be fair I do I do prefer.</p>
<p>It's up to you how you want to do this right but.</p>
<p>Can either pull things in locally from the project.</p>
<p>Can you use like a central location folder.</p>
<p>Most of my homemade projects you'll see that like kit shot kick shot mazda's murder mystery output upskill just s*** that i'm just like doing on a daily basis or whatever but a lot some of it is important i've got like python scripts in here i've got like all kinds of stuff and pc boo uses pc boost translations go in here the facts are in here.</p>
<p>I like to keep them all in one folder because it's just one little folder that I have to back up.</p>
<p>And you know I know that no matter how many projects I have on the go once I only have this one folder to take care of the projects themselves are backed up anywhere but the problem is you end up with sometimes you're not like 15 versions of the same project and then you like oh why is this not working it's like oh it's because the debt files i'm pulling in it from version 4 and i'm on version 14 but if you pull all the data files from one central location then as long as those data files are correct then you should be good so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a folder in my seed dump and i'm going to call it transcribe.</p>
<p>Is our transcribe.</p>
<p>Files that we want to work with in here.</p>
<p>Sea dump transcribe ok so what do we need well we need a header right if we look at our list of what we need we outlined what we need to do.</p>
<p>I mean we need the transcript but the transcript is in the sea dump folder anyway so we can pull that in no problem.</p>
<p>Html file so what we do is we go.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>We go to a.</p>
<p>Valid.</p>
<p>Transcript that's ready to go so if I go to my web page.</p>
<p>You need to have like you need to have this down first right so make sure your html page you have like one or two at least one one or two example pages that are made by hand first and just double check that everything looks good and everything runs properly.</p>
<p>Because I mean you can always change this but essentially if you want to get this part right.</p>
<p>And then all you need to do is go to your full html file right and you'll find what you should find.</p>
<p>Is that you'll have three sections that you want you want to split that file into three sections and the three sections that that file would be split up with for anything that's dynamic is simply.</p>
<p>Three dynamic.</p>
<p>The dynamic content.</p>
<p>Unpause dynamic it's not even content it's called.</p>
<p>It's pray dynamic chord it's dynamic content.</p>
<p>Dismiss sound complicated but it's not.</p>
<p>All I mean by this is we took our scrapped we took our transcript for hours it's very simple we took our transcript and we simply put paragraph html.</p>
<p>Tax on them right so that.</p>
<p>The webpage knows it's a unique paragraph.</p>
<p>But you might want more things right so if you're if you're generating like a player leaderboard for example this is good for games and stuff right you might want to save leaderboards for players right you might be like ok every player who scores above a certain threshold or everybody you registered in the account on the game we're going to meet we're going to dynamically give them lots of games do this now right every ff14 player has a profile page on ff14 it's a great way to get more eyes on your game right so once a player is registered you might have like hitch one tag the players name or play profile or whatever h2 tag the players name you want to make sure all those tags are set up so once you've got your best status so basically the game wants to spit it out.</p>
<p>Tag it all up mark it all up right.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>You separate your process right so you've already got your debt apart.</p>
<p>What your program that's generating html pages needs to do is you need to wrap all this in it right so you need to you need to do the pre card then you need to put the wrapping within the dynamic content and then you need to put the postcode and then boom done you've got a dynamic you've got you've got a html page.</p>
<p>Transcript pages so he's our transcript page.</p>
<p>Javascript that way I need one menu but all of this needs to be in there.</p>
<p>I've got a disclaimer that says transcripts are generated by pc boo.</p>
<p>To help assist in finding a stream with content covering your required topic.</p>
<p>What was actually set on stream is probably not what's here.</p>
<p>Bought this can help you find what you're looking for the reason i'm saying that is if a bunch of stupid little kids want to try and cancel me one there and they're like oh when's he said the n word when he said the n word i've never said the n word but it might have heard me say the n word one there even I said something completely different I don't think it would cause that wouldn't be in there I wouldn't think I don't think it would be in google.</p>
<p>Like every time I say f*** for example.</p>
<p>Why is it I just sit there.</p>
<p>It was just so f****** good so like yeah.</p>
<p>If someone wants to cancel me you know good luck.</p>
<p>But it's just a cover my ass just in case it's you know it says something really it thinks I said something really bad and I never actually said that.</p>
<p>No I might flash this out more because I could actually put time stamps on this so that you know roughly where it wasn't in the stream for now we're just going to leave it as we might do that.</p>
<p>I want to make a new tab and what we're going to do this new tab is going to be the the.</p>
<p>Down to where the dynamic content wants to start generating.</p>
<p>I'm going to put hash yt.</p>
<p>Linked hash whether you.</p>
<p>Play youtube link should be.</p>
<p>So that way I was our programme can just replace hash date hash with the date and hash youtube link hash with you guessed it.</p>
<p>Ok and then our dynamic content begins right here.</p>
<p>So I want to delete everything from here.</p>
<p>With what specific to the specific stream.</p>
<p>And that's the start that's the very start if we wanted to we could put live in the header we could say live stream transcript.</p>
<p>Let's do it.</p>
<p>And then we could put in the description and the meta description.</p>
<p>But it's a good idea because meta is good for letting people find things find things and stuff right so play compile.</p>
<p>Max unity mini-game tutorials.</p>
<p>Please games.</p>
<p>Don't folder.</p>
<p>Transcripts folder.</p>
<p>Use it right.</p>
<p>And we'll make a new script.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>Have you seen.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>And then we'll attach the transcribe.</p>
<p>Script to the transcribe objects.</p>
<p>Ok beautiful it would be nice to have some form of feedback.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Every single time I do this.</p>
<p>Resolution and presentation I do not want to full screen window I want a window.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be that big to be honest.</p>
<p>So what i'm going to do he's a trick.</p>
<p>Ok i'll make it about this.</p>
<p>This is fine if my trance if my transcript program is about this sizing probably be a bit thinner to be honest.</p>
<p>What's loaded on the wrong screen for some reason.</p>
<p>We can snip that.</p>
<p>Test.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Good job I wasn't bloody I don't know take pictures of my.</p>
<p>Dr i'll send you a picture of my bleeding call on so you can give me the diagnosis and then right in the middle of the live stream.</p>
<p>Anyway right so.</p>
<p>655690 sounds good.</p>
<p>That's the wrong one.</p>
<p>659 will 660 is.</p>
<p>Buy 690.</p>
<p>Don't need the player log.</p>
<p>Don't need full screen switch.</p>
<p>Find all sounds good to me.</p>
<p>Am I running in 20226 cos I could have avoided the splash screen but it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Let's give it a background colour.</p>
<p>So we can pick up a background cauliflower.</p>
<p>Take that constant pixel size 6.</p>
<p>Next screen with 6.</p>
<p>60 by 690 scale the screen size set the size 0.5 boom where's our.</p>
<p>What are we looking at.</p>
<p>Why is it doing this.</p>
<p>Unity what the hell are you doing.</p>
<p>Unity what are you doing to me.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing to me.</p>
<p>Free aspect.</p>
<p>Vsync game view only.</p>
<p>Free aspect I guess.</p>
<p>I mean yeah that's.</p>
<p>Play 6ix9ine I still looks way too wide to me.</p>
<p>It should be skinnier than it is.</p>
<p>There's no way that's 660 by 690 right.</p>
<p>It's too wide.</p>
<p>I have no idea what the hell it's planner.</p>
<p>Let's actually use this image right because I don't know what the f*** is going on and be honest.</p>
<p>What the hell is happening.</p>
<p>What is going on.</p>
<p>I wish I freaking knew.</p>
<p>I I do not know what the hell is happening right now why aren't we looking at that.</p>
<p>What is going on.</p>
<p>That's the wrong folder.</p>
<p>I just want to get in and call this ok I want to be here all day this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Canvas a normal jpeg why does why aren't we seeing it.</p>
<p>What is going on.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Set native size.</p>
<p>Even then we don't see it I don't I do not know what is happening.</p>
<p>I have no idea what is happening.</p>
<p>Why don't we see anything on there why is it just blank.</p>
<p>The biggest the biggest thing i'm confused about right now.</p>
<p>Is why the hell is it blank.</p>
<p>Ok let me just come out of this.</p>
<p>I have no idea what is happening.</p>
<p>Go to hell.</p>
<p>Remove projects.</p>
<p>Delete project let's start again I don't know what the hell it's doing.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I have no clue.</p>
<p>Piss off get out my size.</p>
<p>Just what do you mean it's open no it's not delete it right now.</p>
<p>Piss off then.</p>
<p>Write new project unity 6.</p>
<p>Latest version.</p>
<p>Currently we don't have 2d built in render pipeline car.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>Create project.</p>
<p>Who's very quiet as well why did you ever say anything anymore.</p>
<p>Engagement.</p>
<p>Ok I turn I turn these up to insane values I guess.</p>
<p>He wanted to wear 5,326 seconds for his next engagement.</p>
<p>Which is what exactly.</p>
<p>5,326 minutes.</p>
<p>Add seconds is 88 minutes.</p>
<p>6 singh's.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>Will you type properly.</p>
<p>Canvas.</p>
<p>Rummage.</p>
<p>Photoshop.</p>
<p>I think that's in the right folder it's hard to tell.</p>
<p>Going again just to make sure transcribe assets.</p>
<p>What sound does a png this time I don't think that would make any difference untitled one is fine.</p>
<p>It's just to get an idea.</p>
<p>Tell me what the numbers should be 6.</p>
<p>6:55 x 690.</p>
<p>Yeah why doesn't that why isn't that changing the.</p>
<p>No because it's still like.</p>
<p>You're saying that 6:55.</p>
<p>And you sing that's 3608 so where the f*** are you.</p>
<p>68 from.</p>
<p>Constant size.</p>
<p>I can't size that in here 1920 so where are you getting the screen size from probably place settings than I am.</p>
<p>Full screen.</p>
<p>So I guess I need to learn this myself.</p>
<p>Project settings.</p>
<p>Graphics.</p>
<p>When dodd.</p>
<p>6:55 x 690.</p>
<p>Don't use log.</p>
<p>Don't full screen switch fast single instance.</p>
<p>Exit.</p>
<p>How the hell do you tell the uni what's and I have done before but.</p>
<p>How do you get unity.</p>
<p>Also what's this package manager window arrow while getting access.</p>
<p>Stop music wants me to log in and out of unity again.</p>
<p>1080 by 1920.</p>
<p>Which is full hd.</p>
<p>5:17.</p>
<p>6:24.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Ok but that looks more like the kind.</p>
<p>Aspect ratio that we should be working with right.</p>
<p>I think so let's get the image that we added.</p>
<p>Set the native size on that here we go this is looking promising.</p>
<p>So we can start to see.</p>
<p>So is that an accurate representation of our screen canvas.</p>
<p>Let's find out.</p>
<p>I still don't know why it came up with those arbitrary size numbers though.</p>
<p>Was at the size numbers that we set I really don't understand un.</p>
<p>We've got constant pixel size what if we change.</p>
<p>Are constant physical size.</p>
<p>Dbi.</p>
<p>Scale with screen size 655 x 690.</p>
<p>Folder.</p>
<p>We need 100 bills.</p>
<p>We can turn the splash screen off this cos when unit is 6.</p>
<p>Are.</p>
<p>Sample saying.</p>
<p>What is happening normally have an ad currency where's my add currency in button.</p>
<p>Open seamless add open scenes.</p>
<p>I build and run.</p>
<p>Build.</p>
<p>Unity.</p>
<p>So why are you telling me that the size of the window is this if it's not actually that.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>I wish I understood how this work it doesn't make any sense constant physical size let's try this like I said I don't I don't make that many things in unity aren't full screen so i'm not really that familiar with how this works but it seems kind of counterintuitive if it gives me a canvas based on what I put in the build settings.</p>
<p>And then it does not match that canvas then why the f*** not right.</p>
<p>Surely it should.</p>
<p>You think.</p>
<p>I finally that's not how we do it in crazy town.</p>
<p>Right ok save building run.</p>
<p>What about this is this the right size.</p>
<p>Now it's too small jesus christ unity.</p>
<p>What is your.</p>
<p>I genuinely don't understand right we set like why doesn't the canvas accurately represent our actual canvas like wow what a novel idea.</p>
<p>Let me just google this.</p>
<p>Something like this unity canvas not reflecting let me ask you maybe just.</p>
<p>Not reflecting bills window settings.</p>
<p>This is so dumb.</p>
<p>I mean I guess we need we need to get.</p>
<p>Some values are driven by canvas.</p>
<p>Canvas is on screen space overlay.</p>
<p>We set our window in build settings.</p>
<p>Right but it seems like this white box.</p>
<p>Has zero f****** connection to build settings.</p>
<p>So what's it connected to god's left f****** testicle like it's so f****** stupid.</p>
<p>Like what what the hell is this.</p>
<p>I hate stupid things like this.</p>
<p>At 1.2 told me your dimensions how do I get you to show me your dimensions.</p>
<p>I can't resize you.</p>
<p>Here 5:17 you are 5/17 wide apparently.</p>
<p>Will where the hell is 517 anywhere in this thing.</p>
<p>Nowhere that's where so where the f*** are you getting 5:17 from.</p>
<p>Is poland number of your ass.</p>
<p>I told you to have a width of 655 so why would your width be 5:17 that doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Right canvas vs default screen.</p>
<p>Shouldn't these things match up.</p>
<p>Google is like absolutely useless these days.</p>
<p>You get everything but what you actually search for.</p>
<p>I may as well have searched for my little pony butt plug.</p>
<p>I hate s*** like this that just doesn't make any sense make it make sense to me.</p>
<p>Make it make sense.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make an app in unity.</p>
<p>With window 6:55 it doesn't really matter what the size is of a specific size let's say right.</p>
<p>When switching to free aspect.</p>
<p>In.</p>
<p>End view.</p>
<p>I get that aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Canvas.</p>
<p>In the editor.</p>
<p>But when I build.</p>
<p>The guide for the canvas.</p>
<p>Is completely off.</p>
<p>How can I accurately.</p>
<p>Present my apps.</p>
<p>Actual canvas in the fricking editor.</p>
<p>Represents what you will see in the built version you can take the following steps set a fixed resolution in game view.</p>
<p>How do I do that.</p>
<p>Are here.</p>
<p>Ok this is so stupid.</p>
<p>6:55.</p>
<p>Play 690 ok this might be what i'm looking for yeah to be fair I was looking for that but because I didn't see I didn't notice that plus ok this might now we might be in business.</p>
<p>I got a why do you have to put it in 6 billion places though.</p>
<p>We might be getting somewhere.</p>
<p>Close enough.</p>
<p>Boss enough ok let's build that out.</p>
<p>Also let me just quickly build profiles how do I turn.</p>
<p>Flash off.</p>
<p>Play settings.</p>
<p>Please play settings.</p>
<p>Play settings.</p>
<p>Splash image.</p>
<p>Go f*** yourself.</p>
<p>Spell do it.</p>
<p>Put the resolution in your preview thing.</p>
<p>All the canvases really doing is showing you your preview window it's got nothing to do with your actual app which seems really weird to me but ok whatever.</p>
<p>So you have to first set the exact canvas size in your game view.</p>
<p>Otherwise.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>So let's just make it black for now whatever doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Dark blue or something I don't know it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>Ok so the first thing i'm going to do is put.</p>
<p>What's your name.</p>
<p>Whatever transcriber by player compile.</p>
<p>Normally make full screen games right so I don't normally mess with that.</p>
<p>So that's why i'm just not that familiar with it to be fair that kind of brings a bell I think I remember eventually discovering that before but like it's like.</p>
<p>I cannot spell today can i.</p>
<p>I really can't can i.</p>
<p>Ok so the first the first piece of information.</p>
<p>What is this an hour.</p>
<p>An hour.</p>
<p>Hurry up.</p>
<p>This might take a while.</p>
<p>Good job I live for eternity.</p>
<p>Can you unity I swear got swag on youtube I like the torture twins.</p>
<p>Freaking visual studio in unity the lake.</p>
<p>Information I want to start.</p>
<p>Is the date right.</p>
<p>System.</p>
<p>So we'll call this stream date.</p>
<p>I need to store a date in my app.</p>
<p>How can I add a calendar control to the canvas for the user to add a calendar control in uni you need to implement a custom solution since you need to provide a built-in calendar control you can either build a calendar ui from scratch or fun.</p>
<p>I use a third party.</p>
<p>Count the panel create an empty game object into the canvas name at countdown ok let's search get home and see if someone's made a calendar control.</p>
<p>Where's the giving me one.</p>
<p>Let me just make a calendar control for you.</p>
<p>Well normally right to be fair.</p>
<p>I can see what it's doing it's letting me go back again forward a day.</p>
<p>That I have to like move that.</p>
<p>Any direction at moore's maybe i'm going back a couple of days or whatever so that's actually that yeah I don't really need a full calendar control to be completely honest.</p>
<p>Ok yeah so on second thoughts what we can do then.</p>
<p>Is we're going to put an input box.</p>
<p>Let's make two columns first.</p>
<p>So i'm going to do left.</p>
<p>Oh my god I even spell left wrong.</p>
<p>Left and right so on the left side i'm going to add a legacy text component and i'm just going to say stream date.</p>
<p>I'm gonna write justify it.</p>
<p>Give a nice colour.</p>
<p>Nicely.</p>
<p>Just did that.</p>
<p>Pc booze and parrot mod.</p>
<p>Stream dance.</p>
<p>So I want another text control on the right side.</p>
<p>Which will actually show the date so we'll show the date here right.</p>
<p>And we're left justify this one.</p>
<p>And then what I want is a button.</p>
<p>Let's call it earlier.</p>
<p>I will put the earlier button there.</p>
<p>So this will default to today's date.</p>
<p>Nfl's not the right date I can click earlier and it will just keep going back again until it lands on the day that I want that's literally all I need.</p>
<p>So the first thing we need is.</p>
<p>We need our.</p>
<p>Date.</p>
<p>Will be linked to the debt control so for this we need a unity ui.</p>
<p>Text.</p>
<p>Txt gas.</p>
<p>So we can link that in the inspector.</p>
<p>The names that they're meant to be so that one is txt did there.</p>
<p>Earlier.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>This is going to be the code that does the the generates the html does the transcribe thing but we now have.</p>
<p>Canvas this is the raw images actually just the background.</p>
<p>On the canvas itself it would be good to have code that handles these things like the buttons and everything else so i'm actually just going to make a script and i'm going to call it.</p>
<p>In the face.</p>
<p>On the background.</p>
<p>What transcribe can do is transcribe can just pull this date field.</p>
<p>Write and then it's using that as the date.</p>
<p>First thing interface wants to do on start.</p>
<p>Is there any access to system.</p>
<p>So that's also needs to be able to update the date so we'll do a text to xda and here as well.</p>
<p>And then on start we're.</p>
<p>Cxt date.</p>
<p>Text equals daytime.</p>
<p>Say it kind of is now.</p>
<p>I need it to just show the date.</p>
<p>Ok so we'll hit run.</p>
<p>Oh it did.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>It's actually got.</p>
<p>Set on the time now we can quickly and easily fix this because we don't want the time right because the time is relevant.</p>
<p>Just to make sure that it's not putting the time and i'm going to actually make this big enough to star it and if we run it now we'll actually see the time which we don't want and then we'll know that we fixed it ok so how do we get rid of the time so we can easily get rid of the time by saying.</p>
<p>Stream.</p>
<p>Get this.</p>
<p>Pause the time now.</p>
<p>Two string.</p>
<p>And then we can say get this.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>We need to make a string around which is split test.</p>
<p>Which equals get this.</p>
<p>Split.</p>
<p>And now we should just get the date.</p>
<p>There we go 21st of august 2 0.</p>
<p>Now buttons can be a b**** to be honest.</p>
<p>Buttons can be a b****.</p>
<p>Sometimes they just work sometimes they're a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Ok so the first thing we need to do is.</p>
<p>Honestly the easiest way I found to get buttons to work in a system like this.</p>
<p>Is to just create a quick and dirty easy bull listener.</p>
<p>I'm here here's how we do it.</p>
<p>Say create.</p>
<p>I create an object called listener right.</p>
<p>I'm going to do a on the interface i'm just going to do a public game objects.</p>
<p>This is a weird way of doing it but I find this the quickest eas.</p>
<p>The reason I do that is if i.</p>
<p>Event handler here on click and we can.</p>
<p>Say game objects.</p>
<p>Game objects and we can tell it to an apple.</p>
<p>Basically sir.</p>
<p>Right so for each listener we can now do a private game object.</p>
<p>Farm got fined.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Earlier.</p>
<p>Top gear objects.</p>
<p>Active self.</p>
<p>Is true.</p>
<p>Then the first thing we want to do is.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Earlier.</p>
<p>False turn it back off so it doesn't run on an infinite loop.</p>
<p>Here is our chord for basically going back a day so we basically want to.</p>
<p>So since right before we were using now so instead what we should do is instead of saying date time now we should say we need to get the date time from itself essentially so we need to say.</p>
<p>And get current is basically txt dates dot text but we're doing it we need to do a conversion on that.</p>
<p>To date time.</p>
<p>Txt dad..</p>
<p>And now we have the current date.</p>
<p>Can you get current so then get it wants to be.</p>
<p>Set current.</p>
<p>Add dish.</p>
<p>-1 which subtracts a day.</p>
<p>Set convert that back into a string.</p>
<p>Exactly correct.</p>
<p>Ok what might be helpful as well I think.</p>
<p>Is to say what day of the week it is.</p>
<p>Dislike it's a more human way of doing things because I can see me sort of thinking oh s*** I forgot to do last tuesday's stream or whatever it was right so would be good to show the date.</p>
<p>Day of the week so what i'm going to do i'm just going to this is something that chat gbt will be able to do in an instant and i'll send you a lot of work so i'm just going to go and use not hard to.</p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>I'd like to show the day.</p>
<p>Of the week.</p>
<p>Before.</p>
<p>Repeat that.</p>
<p>In my script.</p>
<p>How can I add that we're going to go.</p>
<p>Make a new chat to it just so it doesn't get confused.</p>
<p>It just makes it more helpful like from a human like you know perspective.</p>
<p>Yep today's wednesday.</p>
<p>Yep wednesday's.</p>
<p>Is there are there any problem is it's changed the weather date displays I didn't want it to do that it's now showing the date in like f****** reverse whatever farmer I did not want it to do that.</p>
<p>I like to date in the british way that it was doing it.</p>
<p>So we can do.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah yeah.</p>
<p>Yep that's more like it wednesday 21st of august.</p>
<p>Oh I guess.</p>
<p>Dad dad.</p>
<p>That's nice.</p>
<p>The end of the day it's just nice to know what day of the week this represents because you know.</p>
<p>It takes no time at all just to show what day of the week that actually represents but it's so helpful from like a user perspective cos i'm like oh s*** it was last tuesday's stream and i'm like ah then I have to look up what date was last tuesday and it's just like you know just show me they're going to see what I can see exactly where I am that is fantastic I love that ok so now we can set the stream date.</p>
<p>On the transcript.</p>
<p>Pretty nicely.</p>
<p>Youtube link for the stream.</p>
<p>And what we can do here.</p>
<p>Is we can add a grid layout.</p>
<p>If we.</p>
<p>So a grid layout.</p>
<p>I can basically say fixed column count 1.</p>
<p>How tall is I want to be.</p>
<p>I just screwed everything up tonight.</p>
<p>I'll be honest I have no idea.</p>
<p>Why it's doing that.</p>
<p>Does it include children as.</p>
<p>Specifically.</p>
<p>Ignore me I kind of broke everything.</p>
<p>What we can do is going to control instead my way back to before even adding those yeah that made things so much worse.</p>
<p>You can line it up with a grid layout view but in our situation that's probably not a good idea.</p>
<p>Youtube.</p>
<p>Link.</p>
<p>So we want to link the youtube.</p>
<p>A new.</p>
<p>Input fields there it is.</p>
<p>We'll see how this one treats us.</p>
<p>And youtube links can be quite big so it's going to fill all of that there and this is going to let us play.</p>
<p>Play youtube link.</p>
<p>Ok so let's make sure.</p>
<p>Accept that.</p>
<p>So if we're going to do this now.</p>
<p>Let's.</p>
<p>The stream here.</p>
<p>Copy link address.</p>
<p>16 yeah I think 16 is better.</p>
<p>All right beautiful so that can be.</p>
<p>The text component I think so.</p>
<p>Yeah it goes and text so what i'm going to do is i'm going to rename this to txt.</p>
<p>Link.</p>
<p>Text.</p>
<p>Txt link.</p>
<p>Am I going to link that.</p>
<p>So we can pull the youtube link in.</p>
<p>Alright is that all we need to be honest.</p>
<p>I think that's all we really need for now.</p>
<p>A button a go ahead yeah I don't really need anything else all I need to do is a user is set the date and set the youtube.</p>
<p>So let's copy our button.</p>
<p>But we can use like we can use the bottom of this to make sure progress or whatever.</p>
<p>So let's grab our button from earlier.</p>
<p>I make a newborn.</p>
<p>Start.</p>
<p>Play ok so we got a button that says create transcript.</p>
<p>And a newcastle we're going to make a new listener.</p>
<p>Make sure it's disabled by default.</p>
<p>Let's make sure our.</p>
<p>Cos our transcript is going to be the thing that actually.</p>
<p>Is it essentially so i'm going to do a I need the one.</p>
<p>The one link which is clickstart so i'm going to make it public game object click start will link it and here we can say if click start.</p>
<p>Active self.</p>
<p>Is true.</p>
<p>Script right so we'll do avoid.</p>
<p>Transcript.</p>
<p>Can you make a function called create transcript and then we'll just say create transcript.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>Do the actual thing here.</p>
<p>Log.</p>
<p>Begin.</p>
<p>Transcribing.</p>
<p>And we want to click start linkedin there.</p>
<p>All right we could also do some like.</p>
<p>Create create transcript.</p>
<p>And we've got no youtube link in here it should actually say.</p>
<p>At the moment we just want to see it so that it's creating transcripts.</p>
<p>Set active to true.</p>
<p>For the first thing we need to do is an if statement in here to see whether there's actually a youtube link so we can set if.</p>
<p>Txt link.</p>
<p>Dot text.</p>
<p>Starts with.</p>
<p>Https.</p>
<p>Alright then create transcript.</p>
<p>Else.</p>
<p>We don't have any ui with doing it yet but essentially else this.</p>
<p>I want to tell the user i.</p>
<p>You forgot to put a.</p>
<p>A youtube url so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make a let's just grab one of these left link labels for now.</p>
<p>I make it red for an error.</p>
<p>And it's an error.</p>
<p>Set alarm.</p>
<p>Are we contest actually we could turn this on or off.</p>
<p>For our specific purpose.</p>
<p>You must enter a valid youtube link.</p>
<p>Transcribe with my youtube link.</p>
<p>But by default.</p>
<p>Youtube.</p>
<p>So back in our transcribe that needs to know about that.</p>
<p>Our youtube and then we can just say aaron youtube.</p>
<p>Set active to true.</p>
<p>And if we successfully transcribing it means that error was fixed so we can go ahead and turn that off.</p>
<p>And I also wants to be off by default.</p>
<p>And then click it.</p>
<p>And it didn't work ok why didn't it work.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>Oh I know why yeah I do know why.</p>
<p>No don't actually.</p>
<p>Strange.</p>
<p>Oh yes ok.</p>
<p>I accidentally linked labeling.</p>
<p>Instead of text link this is the one we want to link.</p>
<p>Why won't it let me link that.</p>
<p>Is it a text message pro components.</p>
<p>I think it's a text mesh.</p>
<p>Components.</p>
<p>Txt link will know if we got it right because we will go back to our transcribe.</p>
<p>And then we try to assign that it should show now txt link.</p>
<p>Youtube link so because youtube link doesn't start with https it was saying no.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>All right now the fun part we actually start the whole process.</p>
<p>Why do you keep disappearing in.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to debug.</p>
<p>It was fine until I changed a couple of things over the other day I don't really know why that's happening.</p>
<p>Right so what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>I want to do a public string which i'm going to call.</p>
<p>Heather.</p>
<p>Do a public list of strings actually this would be better.</p>
<p>System.</p>
<p>Collections.</p>
<p>Generic.</p>
<p>Also this should be a core routine so let's put it in coroutine the reason we're going to put it in chorus unit so we can get feedback as it's happening.</p>
<p>Change this tokoro team.</p>
<p>Create transcript it's going to generate arrows because it doesn't return anything so just do yield return null to get rid of that error and then make sure that instead of saying create transcript which you can start to start coroutine.</p>
<p>And we should be good.</p>
<p>List of strings.</p>
<p>What time will it call.</p>
<p>Transcript.</p>
<p>Equals a new list of strings.</p>
<p>So the first thing I want to do is i'm going to give this an output so that we can see what it's doing any given moment.</p>
<p>So let's go into a canvas and we'll just use the alexa.</p>
<p>The one that already exists for now.</p>
<p>We'll call this txt output.</p>
<p>What's the types of random nonsense in there so we can colour it size it and make it look however we want.</p>
<p>Yeah that's fine.</p>
<p>Delete text txt outfits.</p>
<p>Which will link.</p>
<p>Each stage in here we can update the output to see what it's doing.</p>
<p>Txt out for there's also.</p>
<p>Play fails or whatever we can know where it's failing right so txt output.txt equals.</p>
<p>Reading head up file.</p>
<p>Always yields return new weather in the frame if you want to actually see that otherwise it will just go off and do everything else and not draw that frame.</p>
<p>So if you actually want that to.</p>
<p>And we can simply say.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Equals file.</p>
<p>Read all text and then.</p>
<p>Text.</p>
<p>Of course if you want it if you.</p>
<p>I don't see the point in adding extra input fields that i'm never going to use because it would be no.</p>
<p>What you may need more control obviously you could.</p>
<p>You can make this pull it from a ui element if you wish.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>How do.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what this is this at sign basically means it's an absolute string because normally back spaces wouldn't be allowed.</p>
<p>An escape sequence which is double backslashes if he used to do in python you might be familiar with these c sharp works in a similar way but you can just escape the whole thing by just putting it out which just means oh you could use forward slashes there's so many ways of doing it.</p>
<p>It's nice.</p>
<p>Escape sequences.</p>
<p>Anytime you put a backslash.</p>
<p>It basically says like don't read the next backslash as a.</p>
<p>Let's go and do that now.</p>
<p>Inspect.</p>
<p>Go back to my webpage.</p>
<p>Make a new tab.</p>
<p>This is obviously everything after the dynamically generated content it's very very small in my case all I do is I close the device the divider the div I close the body in a closed the html.</p>
<p>That can be saved as.</p>
<p>Transcribe.</p>
<p>So first of all we need a youtube link otherwise it won't work.</p>
<p>What did I forget to link.</p>
<p>Are txt output.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>We can see our header.</p>
<p>When incorrectly there's our header.</p>
<p>We can see our photo when incorrectly there's our father now we just need to go and line by line process the transcript and then all we have to do is write a new text file with header transcript and fodder.</p>
<p>Light on.</p>
<p>I always forget to send text.</p>
<p>I always forget syntax.</p>
<p>What was the most recent project we did.</p>
<p>There'll be one.</p>
<p>And I definitely do on murder mystery.</p>
<p>Can I do a joke and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Murder evidence i'm pretty sure we did it on.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>This is a bit I always I was getting confused with this let.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Using I need to remember this using stream reader and then define the stream reader and then construct the stream reader with the file.</p>
<p>And then within that we said while stream.</p>
<p>Peach which we call as a function is greater than equal to 0 yeah i'm never going to remember that I don't know why that's so confusing to me but anyway that's the best way to do it because you don't have.</p>
<p>Less than a week less than a week before told I was station.</p>
<p>I am totally devastated consider me totally devastated ok so our transcripts actually lives in.</p>
<p>Transcript because pc boost serves it to transcript of txt.</p>
<p>Ok and then we can just do.</p>
<p>Get data equals.</p>
<p>Sr redline the first the first thing we want to do is.</p>
<p>Reflect our ui to reading transcript.</p>
<p>File.</p>
<p>And then within each line of data here we could actually.</p>
<p>On that if we wanted to.</p>
<p>Processing.</p>
<p>Now this will slow the whole thing down and we have thousands of lines so actually this is really bad practice i'll show you really good practice.</p>
<p>Well let's have a look at our last transcript write our last transcript the web page.</p>
<p>Is a total of.</p>
<p>1,800 lines right.</p>
<p>So are transcript was around about that.</p>
<p>Here's the reason why what i'm about.</p>
<p>What was about to do is bad practice it's because unity will run at about.</p>
<p>On a good day 200 frames a second.</p>
<p>What were essentially doing is we're saying process one line of text on every frame rate so it means we can only process 200 lines.</p>
<p>Every second I mean it's not that bad.</p>
<p>But the whole thing would take 9 seconds right.</p>
<p>Which isn't really that bad 9 seconds is not that bad.</p>
<p>But it can actually do it.</p>
<p>Stop it can literally do it within a fraction of a second so you're slowing the thing down by like.</p>
<p>2030 x.</p>
<p>So what's the solution.</p>
<p>The best solution I find is to make an integer are we really need to do is update the user every however many lines we want to update the user on right.</p>
<p>What i'll do is.</p>
<p>I'm going to make.</p>
<p>Integer called.</p>
<p>What that basically means is now we can wait until we've done 100 lines before we reflect to the user so only every 100 lines are we are we slowing the whole thing down waiting a frame updating the ui and reflecting it back to the user so essentially it makes it 100 times faster kind of.</p>
<p>Next to nothing.</p>
<p>Will still get some semblance.</p>
<p>Carrots up to right.</p>
<p>We could probably also.</p>
<p>Calculate how many lines are in that file so that we can then figure out ok we are at line blah blah blah which makes it this percentage.</p>
<p>But because we're doing this on the fly and we're reading it line by alan as we go we have no idea how many lines there is so we can't really give a progress bar we don't know how far I had we are so this will be fine.</p>
<p>So essentially all i'm going to do is for each line i'm going to increment outline by one.</p>
<p>Then where we do this update here I can say if count line is the number of update lines then wait for a frame update the ui and don't forget to reset count line back to zero.</p>
<p>And what essentially that will do is.</p>
<p>What's 100 lines before updating the use of the sandwich line work to which will make the whole thing runs so much quicker.</p>
<p>So much quicker.</p>
<p>Again 9 seconds isn't exactly that bad like.</p>
<p>1 second is better than 9 seconds.</p>
<p>That's fine so as we're going to reach line we check to see if it's 100 lines we up to the user blah blah blah so for each line.</p>
<p>Right so we need to capitalise every first letter of the sentence.</p>
<p>I'm going to say a string fix line equals get data.</p>
<p>Yeah there's a way to.</p>
<p>That is too low I think.</p>
<p>Two sentence.</p>
<p>2 upper in variants I wonder if it's too operating variants let me ask chat gbt.</p>
<p>There's really not function for ok apparently there's no function for interesting.</p>
<p>Ok it's giving me a nice little tool that to do it though which is quite nice.</p>
<p>So basically it takes a string in called input.</p>
<p>Returns an empty string it trims the string meaning it gets rid of any annoying white space and s*** and it says character.to oba.</p>
<p>In position 0 yes essentially.</p>
<p>Input substring too low.</p>
<p>Ok so now what we do then is we say fix line equals 2 sentence case.</p>
<p>Get down.</p>
<p>So that's that done.</p>
<p>On a full stop at the end.</p>
<p>That's easy.</p>
<p>Will do.</p>
<p>Axis next to we need to add p and closing p tags while again we can do that here so we'll say.</p>
<p>Plus.</p>
<p>And in closing p tag.</p>
<p>Play space.</p>
<p>Lowercase space.</p>
<p>Fix line.</p>
<p>Replace.</p>
<p>Play spurs with spurs capitalised spurs.</p>
<p>What's our manual labour part done.</p>
<p>And then head up with reading fodder we've had in the youtube link we're gonna read in.</p>
<p>We didn't include this in here but if we're looking our header txt our head of txt is where we put dates and stuff.</p>
<p>Add some functionality to this now so we say read all text right but then what we want to do here is the header.</p>
<p>Equals header.</p>
<p>Replace.</p>
<p>Hash dates.</p>
<p>With.</p>
<p>Txt date.</p>
<p>Dots text.</p>
<p>Maybe I will include the day of the week.</p>
<p>Will we need to do some clever things when it comes to the file name.</p>
<p>Because there is like a.</p>
<p>Fix line to the transcript.</p>
<p>Also we're working with a live file right now that's being updated constantly every time I speak the file gets updated.</p>
<p>I don't think it will cause any problems but.</p>
<p>Aids transcripts.</p>
<p>Does nowhere we've only got eight transcripts right.</p>
<p>Where is my dump fire my dump fold on I don't fall asleep it's 40 kilobytes i'm pretty sure it won't be 8 lines.</p>
<p>Yeah ok so already today's transcript is.</p>
<p>833 lines what are g******* I am.</p>
<p>Actually you might want to visit play compile dot calm and see just how much I took b****.</p>
<p>Unless that is an issue with the live file.</p>
<p>Yes wednesday 21st of august I don't see that being a problem do the place it puts it is here.</p>
<p>No that's good.</p>
<p>Are you with the youtube link is in here as well.</p>
<p>Ok so we need to process the youtube link on the header.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that it gave up online 7.</p>
<p>Put no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Yeah it could be that it was alive file so maybe as i'm speaking and unit is updating the file maybe it rebuilds the file each time so at the exact frame that it happened to read it maybe it was only 7 lines long.</p>
<p>Ok let's test this so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my live transcript file and i'm just going to copy it.</p>
<p>I'm going to need to be silent so that the file is complete.</p>
<p>Test.txt.</p>
<p>Ok and if we look at test.txt we can see.</p>
<p>Test.txt is currently 847 lines.</p>
<p>Eagles header.</p>
<p>Don't replace.</p>
<p>Yt link.</p>
<p>And then we just want to change our file that we read.</p>
<p>Trans transcript to test.</p>
<p>And make sure it runs to the end.</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>You are a skip this one just for a change.</p>
<p>Ok we got.</p>
<p>8 lines again.</p>
<p>Why is it stopping after 8 lines that's very strange.</p>
<p>Ok there's 800 lines ok have an idiot.</p>
<p>I put the code.</p>
<p>What the card for the replacements inside the.</p>
<p>You are the gets updated every 100 lines so we're only actually processing everyone 100 lines there we go I just need to move that down there ok that's why it was only doing it eight lines so I have nothing to do with the fact that we're working with a live file.</p>
<p>847 lines beautiful.</p>
<p>Yeah that all looks good.</p>
<p>I would say so.</p>
<p>How much biased or anything.</p>
<p>So the first thing we need to do is file.</p>
<p>Probably but i'm a unity i'm a unity frog.</p>
<p>Where i've done this before is in games so let's say you've got a leaderboard and again and you want you know like in final fantasy 14 everybody has like a profile page or in like a gacha game everybody can like it'll show their like spiral the best progression or whatever you can put this inside your game so when somebody signs up for your game and then they gone complete some task this is generate this can generate a dynamic web page automatically on the flying create a user profile for the player and everything like that and you want that inside the game itself so yeah i'm sort of showing you how you can do it in unity because that's what I do I make games and stuff like that so yeah you probably right absolutely would be easier on a web development but yeah this is like showing you how you can do it inside your game but basically.</p>
<p>And we need to give it a file name.</p>
<p>So the file name.</p>
<p>What's the weather in ever thought about actually so I might want to add an interface element that says it in early stream or a late stream.</p>
<p>Yeah ok let's do that now then.</p>
<p>Profile pictures for your players.</p>
<p>Push that down.</p>
<p>And since it's related to the stream date we're going to put it in between youtube link.</p>
<p>Subscribe the last.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Youtube.</p>
<p>Is this one.</p>
<p>Scooby-doo toilets I don't know what that is mentioned at my team meeting.</p>
<p>What is scooby-doo toilet.</p>
<p>Label time I guess.</p>
<p>Give me a drop down.</p>
<p>I could be a tick box radio button.</p>
<p>Oh really.</p>
<p>What kind of psyllium I love that back in the day happy tree friends whatever happened to happy tree friends.</p>
<p>Radio buttons would make the most sense I think.</p>
<p>Toddlers checkbox.</p>
<p>Check boxes.</p>
<p>I would have preferred radio buttons thor but drop down.</p>
<p>So here's the options here.</p>
<p>We just want to say whether it's an early stream.</p>
<p>Are late stream and we don't need that third one.</p>
<p>And then i'm available can be slightly larger.</p>
<p>16 there we go.</p>
<p>Determine whether it's got an hour i'll be on the end of the file name basically.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Cruel on I mean I first started programming when I when I was 8 so I had an amstrad cpc 464 which run with a cassette tape and while the other kids are out playing football I was copying lines of code from the instruction manual.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by.</p>
<p>Hobby for me if I worked in it.</p>
<p>Turn the web development made lots of games.</p>
<p>Did some programming college there.</p>
<p>12 years old.</p>
<p>That's crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess so.</p>
<p>I've reached the level now where like you know.</p>
<p>I don't think there's really anything I can't do in unit at least.</p>
<p>And so that's kind of the whole point of like.</p>
<p>Play how you can do it.</p>
<p>Ok so we need to tell transcribe about this drop down box.</p>
<p>So let's see.</p>
<p>I like to keep things in the order that they are so.</p>
<p>Can I put I put time below link but it should be above it so we want time to be on after after date right so i'll do a public.</p>
<p>What do they call us drop down.</p>
<p>Call brp.</p>
<p>I want you to drop down as the legacy version.</p>
<p>I was labelled time.</p>
<p>Input fields.</p>
<p>Play youtube link.</p>
<p>It is called a drop down apparently.</p>
<p>Ok I must be a tmp dropdown.</p>
<p>We're using the tmp drop down so from that we should be able to read the option basically so what we do.</p>
<p>Suffolk name we need to know whether it's an early or a late one so we'll define a string.</p>
<p>File name.</p>
<p>So first we have to say.</p>
<p>Give me the date actually.</p>
<p>Set a time.</p>
<p>Estate for stream dares.</p>
<p>Equals convert.</p>
<p>Stream file name.</p>
<p>West church.</p>
<p>Yeah except we want.</p>
<p>Is string that.</p>
<p>And split the date.</p>
<p>Split date.</p>
<p>Equals tfc debt.</p>
<p>That wants to be an array.</p>
<p>And we're gonna say split.</p>
<p>Txt dad.</p>
<p>Where the hell was my last split.</p>
<p>I did not end up splitting in the end.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on I am so confused.</p>
<p>Stream split days.</p>
<p>It should just come up where the hell does split come from.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to just write.</p>
<p>Split.</p>
<p>That is so weird.</p>
<p>It's so hard to concentrate.</p>
<p>So a string.</p>
<p>Zero.</p>
<p>Set timer for this.</p>
<p>Converse.</p>
<p>2 day time.</p>
<p>Split that zero.</p>
<p>Then we can get our string of.</p>
<p>Estates.</p>
<p>Two string.</p>
<p>What time we can do our formatting.</p>
<p>Do we want if we look at our file name.</p>
<p>We want yeah yeah yeah month month.</p>
<p>And then we either want to add are or b.</p>
<p>So here we can say if.</p>
<p>What do they call it tmp drop down no actually called it.</p>
<p>Drop time drp time so if drp time the option.</p>
<p>Not selected I think.</p>
<p>Set.</p>
<p>Volume.</p>
<p>Down dot value.</p>
<p>My dropdown add listener delegate dropdown value changed.</p>
<p>Selected index equals my dropdown value.</p>
<p>Drop down.</p>
<p>Volume.</p>
<p>Pause = 0 is going to be early late is gonna be.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>So st date.</p>
<p>Eagles file name.</p>
<p>Plus.</p>
<p>Are for the early.</p>
<p>Al's will you be for the lab.</p>
<p>Html is one.</p>
<p>File name.</p>
<p>Ok so we're running our text at.</p>
<p>And this is where for my specific.</p>
<p>Set up.</p>
<p>I need to make sure it goes to my github repo.</p>
<p>That's fine so transcripts plus file name.</p>
<p>And we're waiting header.</p>
<p>File name.</p>
<p>Dish.</p>
<p>Close family.</p>
<p>And I want to do is go through each.</p>
<p>Streamline.</p>
<p>Transcript.</p>
<p>And then we just want to file.</p>
<p>A pendle text.</p>
<p>File name.</p>
<p>Ok that's basically yeah.</p>
<p>That's basically up.</p>
<p>Ok so we need a youtube link.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Format string was not recognised as a valid date time.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Oh yes i'm an idiot.</p>
<p>The day of the week comes first.</p>
<p>Also.</p>
<p>Should we have no we shouldn't have written anything at that point anyway.</p>
<p>You can where's my file but we were still processing the date.</p>
<p>Where the hell is my folder.</p>
<p>We already had a 21st.</p>
<p>Where does it make any sense we shouldn't have had a 21st 21st dare.</p>
<p>What's my transcripts.</p>
<p>Ok I must have how did I miss the oh I know how I messed it up because I was probably work I was probably working on it past midnight.</p>
<p>Ok I think that's what happened.</p>
<p>Ok so first I need to go on.</p>
<p>So let's go to my google ht docs version.</p>
<p>Which is my live testing.</p>
<p>Zombie version.</p>
<p>Because we were just lost we would have lost the original one of those you can see the file size has changed because this thing just tried to process to deadstream is that and then I just want to rename these to 19th and 20th.</p>
<p>So 19th for the 20th.</p>
<p>So this should be the live stream for the 20th this should be the live stream for the 19th.</p>
<p>These now need changing as well 20th.</p>
<p>That should be fine.</p>
<p>Now grab.</p>
<p>Which one did I change.</p>
<p>That is 20th.</p>
<p>Ok that's fine I think.</p>
<p>Now if we're running again.</p>
<p>Is it going to the 21st.</p>
<p>I need to add it.</p>
<p>If you look at my i've got an index there that links them right so if you go to the index.</p>
<p>Properly.</p>
<p>So let's grab these and copy them back over to the ht docs.</p>
<p>So the only way I can really test this.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Play some of that one.</p>
<p>Where I just got a 24-hour the 21st would have been here because they were named the wrong name.</p>
<p>Localhost.</p>
<p>So I got a local cast.</p>
<p>This is my sort of.</p>
<p>My locally hosted website so that I can like work on it and s*** right.</p>
<p>Have I got a transcript now.</p>
<p>I got 19 and 20s.</p>
<p>Yellow seems fine.</p>
<p>That's still says 21st so I need to fix that one but yeah this is what I was basically saying is I also need to add I need to add the live stream to.</p>
<p>Best list right as well.</p>
<p>I want to add.</p>
<p>The live stream to this index as well.</p>
<p>Automatically.</p>
<p>I also want to make sure that early in late thing works as well right so we need a youtube link.</p>
<p>Https.</p>
<p>Why is my link copy link address.</p>
<p>Which is essentially what gets pushed to the live.</p>
<p>Website where the f*** is that.</p>
<p>Now I have a 21st let's make sure the 21st looks good well we can't really know so i'm going to copy that's why I want to do this so if we want to know if the 21st is working properly i'm going to have to copy it over to my local horse version because you'll see why right if I try to run it in here it won't display correctly.</p>
<p>It did add the air though which is nice.</p>
<p>So local horse transcripts.</p>
<p>It added the photo it.</p>
<p>Wipes the file maybe.</p>
<p>Interesting okay.</p>
<p>So it looks like stream writer is wiping the file.</p>
<p>Have you found out if there's a way i've never done it i've never tried to do it like this before I guess.</p>
<p>Is a few ways we could do this I mean we could write a separate file and then read the file in and just dump it back into the new file.</p>
<p>But I wonder if there's a way to get streamwriter to a pen rather than create a new file.</p>
<p>Yes you can set stream radio to append mode.</p>
<p>Default streamwriter will override existing content ok.</p>
<p>Public void a pen to file string file path string content.</p>
<p>Using stream writer right right line content.</p>
<p>So no you're lying really.</p>
<p>I see what it's doing.</p>
<p>It's basically forcing streamwriter to write.</p>
<p>The previous content again before it starts raining it's on content.</p>
<p>But that's not really streamwriter.</p>
<p>Operating differently that's just tricking stream right around the rewriting the old continent again.</p>
<p>A message to start true maybe it's just that true.</p>
<p>Where the f*** is my stream right there it is.</p>
<p>Bula pens.</p>
<p>Should work.</p>
<p>He says with no confidence.</p>
<p>That seems kind of.</p>
<p>By default.</p>
<p>Isn't the safe option the.</p>
<p>Best default option usually.</p>
<p>But apparently not not stream writer stream right around about preservation hell no.</p>
<p>Tell nobody.</p>
<p>Let's set this one to late as well even though it's not just to test that.</p>
<p>Play instead of the air.</p>
<p>Zamp localhost version.</p>
<p>Grab this.</p>
<p>Url.</p>
<p>Go to our local host.</p>
<p>Yeah transcripts.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Beautiful that is lovely.</p>
<p>We have our dynamically generated transcripts.</p>
<p>This is today's transcript by the way and we're not even done yet.</p>
<p>I've talked a lot.</p>
<p>I've said a lot of s***.</p>
<p>I've set a lot of cher.</p>
<p>And you know I know that no matter how many projects I have to go once I only have this one folder to take care of the projects.</p>
<p>This is grace I get to live on forever you know it's really good about this is i'm convinced that chat gpt will find these pages one day and train on this.</p>
<p>So when future chat gpt is completely retarded you'll know why.</p>
<p>It's my fault.</p>
<p>Because if it's training on what i've said god help us all.</p>
<p>God help the future generations that's all i'm saying.</p>
<p>I'm saving humanity though because i'm going to i'm going to break when chachi bt trains on my date of the cam out of my mouth it will become so stupid that it'll be borderline useless and then I never text over the world and humanity thrives so you're welcome.</p>
<p>I'm single-handedly serving humanity by doing.</p>
<p>I hope you appreciate it.</p>
<p>So okay all we need to do now is update the.</p>
<p>What's the time we want to add the live stream to the list of of transcript transcripts write the transcript.</p>
<p>We need to add.</p>
<p>That's so hard to say.</p>
<p>Add the latest transcript to the list of transcripts this page right here.</p>
<p>So the way i'm going to do this because there are comments you can put in.</p>
<p>Okay so here's how i'm going to do this.</p>
<p>Go to amazon.</p>
<p>So many windows up and which one is the right one I don't know why do I work like this I swear I work like some kind of.</p>
<p>Biggest thing in the world brawl ok.</p>
<p>Cydonia be slagging the way I work off.</p>
<p>We say.</p>
<p>Stream.</p>
<p>Guess.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Index.</p>
<p>= file read all text.</p>
<p>And our file name is.</p>
<p>The very specifically.</p>
<p>Very specifically.</p>
<p>Index.htm.</p>
<p>So now we have all of that html code in memory.</p>
<p>And then we just said get index equals.</p>
<p>Ok here's how we do this this is very smart are you watching this is a supanet trick.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is we need to add a delimiter and then we split it into then we add what we want and then we stitch it back together again.</p>
<p>He's how you doing.</p>
<p>You say get index.</p>
<p>Add index stop replaced.</p>
<p>And where you want where we want to add.</p>
<p>New live stream.</p>
<p>Stream but I would need a line break in the.</p>
<p>Blind brake line break santa bad line breaks is just that.</p>
<p>Play some s*** right.</p>
<p>Plus.</p>
<p>Turn the line break.</p>
<p>And the sun s*** is well this is where we need to get get out our syntax so we'll make will make our our s*** right.</p>
<p>So we'll call this html link and html link wants to be so if we grab our html code this is what a link looks like.</p>
<p>So what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>Replace.</p>
<p>You see the escape sequences that.</p>
<p>By default now.</p>
<p>Visual studio never used to do that it does that now though I do quite like that it's quite nice but if if you're using an older version or whatever just sticking at.</p>
<p>Fixes that.</p>
<p>Email right we're going to do hash file hash.</p>
<p>Play compile live stream from.</p>
<p>Hash dates hash.</p>
<p>So then we can say html link equals html link dot replace.</p>
<p>Cash stairs hash.</p>
<p>Where is txt test.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Do you want to replace the file.</p>
<p>String.</p>
<p>Just file.</p>
<p>Equals file name before we go I cannot write that that way we can just say html link.</p>
<p>Equals html link.</p>
<p>Stop replace.</p>
<p>Hash file hash.</p>
<p>Adjust file.</p>
<p>I think that i'll be fine.</p>
<p>But now I need to write that right so we just said file.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>You're also we need to put the h2 back in.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because we don't want to remove we don't want to remove the end of the closing of the h2 tag we just want to add s*** to it.</p>
<p>And this is where we're adding ht.</p>
<p>File copy.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>To back up.</p>
<p>And then write all text.</p>
<p>Why does it say get index had I have no idea why I said get index had a.</p>
<p>Because it's a b****.</p>
<p>I'm a writing get index.</p>
<p>As the output.</p>
<p>Are you ready.</p>
<p>Moment of truth I think this will be fine.</p>
<p>Will actually we saved it as a beer last time just to test.</p>
<p>Obviously I can't do this yet anywhere.</p>
<p>Because the streams not over right so we can't we can't do today's transcript until i've finished streaming and waffling on.</p>
<p>Transcript.</p>
<p>How many disappointed children.</p>
<p>Imagine harmony disappointed.</p>
<p>Takes out there.</p>
<p>Will be so disappointed that you know.</p>
<p>Christmas.</p>
<p>Ok so let's go.</p>
<p>It said it's done.</p>
<p>Html.</p>
<p>We got our backup html.</p>
<p>House.</p>
<p>Are you ready when we hit refresh.</p>
<p>We should have the 21st of august.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Now if we click this it should.</p>
<p>The transcript.</p>
<p>Take off.</p>
<p>End of every stream.</p>
<p>Of waffle that's come out of my mouth will get uploaded to get hub get uploaded to the website.</p>
<p>Used for it.</p>
<p>If I mention look if I mention something specific to unity.</p>
<p>First of all I would have to actually become a useful member of society but let's say one day i'm a useful member of society people are actually learning off me and i'm actually helpful today unity projects and they're like yeah I remember I remember kappy a play compile ran across this issue I can't remember how he fixed it and I can't remember which stream it was from guess what you'll be able to go to search you'll be able to look for that specific thing within my website and this should say yep that was from the stream on wednesday the 21st and then you click the link and it takes you to that stream.</p>
<p>And then good luck finding it within the 6 hours of the stream.</p>
<p>Bodega.</p>
<p>We are good.</p>
<p>Well i'm good.</p>
<p>Is nobody getting the door just give us a second.</p>
<p>Yes it is my drugs.</p>
<p>Big bag of drugs.</p>
<p>Big bag of drugs and i'm not.</p>
<p>Yeah we're good we can build this out i'm ready please for that that's really good.</p>
<p>Hi I will be right back.</p>
<p>So they have it now you know how to in unity.</p>
<p>Unity.</p>
<p>So the end of every stream and all I have to do is tell it what date did I stream was it an early streamer outlet stream where's the youtube link for the stream click create transcript.</p>
<p>It'll update the website for me.</p>
<p>And every every word vomited out of my mouth with norfolk.</p>
<p>Will end up on this website.</p>
<p>My official reason is so that people might need to find some you know.</p>
<p>Previously covered topic that they're not able to find.</p>
<p>Tell the satisfied project.</p>
<p>Will you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Can I get so many windows open.</p>
<p>Believer.</p>
<p>Are we good.</p>
<p>Some semblance of a computer left.</p>
<p>Where where.</p>
<p>Ask us a minimise the.</p>
<p>Will get this.</p>
<p>You just need to.</p>
<p>Get it over and done with.</p>
<p>Is boo still on the guys he still about.</p>
<p>Let me test him.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I wasn't saying yes to that but I wanted to say yes so that anywhere.</p>
<p>So I don't know why he's disappearing.</p>
<p>In the build it doesn't make any sense he's fine now.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>It's very difficult for me to debug if he's not doing it in the editor.</p>
<p>Will keep him in debug mode for now.</p>
<p>But yeah I mean.</p>
<p>From that hopefully you can see how you can you know the skies the limit right you can make any web page.</p>
<p>Dynamically.</p>
<p>And you know instead of a transcript.</p>
<p>It could be leaderboards for players that could be.</p>
<p>What level are you characters.</p>
<p>Characters do you want some kind of player profile right.</p>
<p>Could be anything you want.</p>
<p>Now obviously you would probably need to like ftp that up to your site directly or something.</p>
<p>I have some system that's looking for files.</p>

<p>I'd like a thousand side quests that I haven't done.</p>
<p>I went to the mall and now i've got like.</p>
<p>But yeah like I said like i'm building eight characters.</p>
<p>Which is like unprecedented you would never do that normally so like it's not like it's going to continue to be an issue.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Ok so I need I need money for tonight.</p>
<p>Oh good morning.</p>
<p>I need more than that.</p>

<p>Cars would be more than welcome my green snot cubes filled up as well i've got an additional 13 of filter.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>

<p>Play combine harvester simulator 2024.</p>
<p>Oh my god that's the thing isn't it there's like a farming simulator or something.</p>
<p>S**** and gigs I should probably.</p>
<p>Ok was that enough for the these things.</p>
<p>I mean you know yes women are very.</p>
<p>I don't even know how I can twist that to be honest.</p>
<p>I've said too much.</p>
<p>I need the money.</p>
<p>Shut the hell up.</p>
<p>Can you talk to me like an old b****.</p>
<p>82 grand how much does she need.</p>
<p>See that's enough.</p>
<p>Is it ever enough.</p>
<p>Is it ever raining.</p>
<p>That is enough yeah ok so now jingle or whatever name is is max.</p>
<p>What's a bell.</p>
<p>We have to wait for this thing to get its health bar.</p>
<p>Bug.</p>
<p>It won't let me out.</p>
<p>Ok that's weird.</p>
<p>Is it booked.</p>
<p>It's not moving.</p>
<p>This game is.</p>
<p>Something else.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Do I have any energy left.</p>
<p>So I guess whatever verena.</p>
<p>Needs would be the.</p>
<p>And she needs to twirlees.</p>
<p>Play the 4-h I think.</p>
<p>So it said there was some new.</p>
<p>Saying but I don't actually see it.</p>
<p>I'm so done with this.</p>
<p>They said the adjusted the difficulty of this tonight didn't they and also I was like.</p>
<p>1 hp away from winning and I had like I run out of time as I run out of time the guy like needed hitting one more time and I would have done it so let's go do this last floor but also even if it was the same difficulty.</p>
<p>Wasn't the thing that was changed i've levelled my characters up a teeny bit enough to like you know beat it by that one second that was shot by before I leave.</p>
<p>But yeah it's kind of grinding in an annoying.</p>
<p>He just dance around like a freaking crackhead though it's like.</p>
<p>Tomorrow 9:00 a.m..</p>
<p>Horrendous.</p>
<p>Do I even have the.</p>
<p>Has it tower sounds like it's going to be the.</p>
<p>Electro damage increase.</p>
<p>If I use my second best team let's try this one.</p>
<p>I need to level her up to be further the heel or she's trash but I feel like i'm going to be getting another healer soon what's the point.</p>
<p>Tune in.</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>Insufficient can't do it.</p>
<p>Screw them.</p>
<p>How do I get to rewards the.</p>
<p>When did some flowers.</p>
<p>We did some flowers.</p>
<p>How long she got.</p>
<p>16 days forever.</p>
<p>Misch tragedy tragedy.</p>
<p>Because I need to I need to get some.</p>
<p>Stop battle pass.</p>
<p>In preparation.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This is really bizarre.</p>
<p>48 baby 48.</p>
<p>Scandalous ok.</p>
<p>Let's get it done we can't have a level 20 weapon on I will have you.</p>
<p>That is absolutely.</p>
<p>Sacrilege it's disgusting.</p>
<p>This needs to be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>Final score.</p>
<p>Cryo damage bonus I haven't got any bloody cryo.</p>
<p>What's nice in it.</p>
<p>Are you dead yes you're about to be oh you're about to me.</p>
<p>Crayola.</p>
<p>Is that it.</p>
<p>Make the score.</p>
<p>Are you the condensed and then we'll make a new condenser our caps lifted.</p>
<p>Because this is how we do it.</p>
<p>Go to teapot.</p>
<p>Let's get this.</p>
<p>Does rome could do with you shut your mouth.</p>
<p>Silence fool.</p>
<p>Are the capitals lifted.</p>
<p>We can all sleep peacefully tonight.</p>
<p>Ascend.</p>
<p>Send my beauty level 40 yes send.</p>
<p>Level 50%.</p>
<p>Level 60.</p>
<p>Ascend.</p>
<p>Ok we need the purple's the ones that look like.</p>
<p>What's wrong with you.</p>
<p>Apparently we don't have any well that's fine that's what the reasons for.</p>
<p>Yes we do yes we do.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Ascend.</p>
<p>Ok what are these we need these.</p>
<p>Fossilised bone shard x 8.</p>
<p>Get clothes now.</p>
<p>Ok let's farm then.</p>
<p>Four goals.</p>
<p>What's this.</p>
<p>Discount towards commissions does not.</p>
<p>Why not.</p>
<p>What the heck.</p>
<p>Does canada joke.</p>
<p>Does canada chalk.</p>
<p>Looks a lot better than the other one.</p>
<p>It looks much better than the other one.</p>
<p>I mean I don't know that could be too cold or I can.</p>
<p>Runs will probably have enough.</p>
<p>How many domains have we done because we need to for the battle pass we need to do 10 door man's.</p>
<p>So it might be worth spending.</p>
<p>Uncondensed resin actually I don't know.</p>
<p>15 so that i'm still farming stuff that I don't need just to complete battle pass.</p>
<p>I suppose it.</p>
<p>Helps that goes towards it.</p>
<p>Ronnie 1 1/2 levels away from the max anywhere.</p>
<p>By the time I do dailies.</p>
<p>So should be fine.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even mind better than that that's enough you know but we'll do it one more time because we need we need to do it anyway and like I said anything else.</p>
<p>Willy willy b****.</p>
<p>My god this is so i'm not even playing the game anymore i'm just what's it like it must be insane having like c6 what would be the point what do you do blink next to them and they just die.</p>
<p>Yeah so I think I think that's probably enough for what we need.</p>
<p>But we still want the battle pass.</p>
<p>We might have over farms to be honest.</p>
<p>Let's take a look.</p>
<p>So we got six of those.</p>
<p>9 of those.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Farms we are the farms.</p>
<p>I want to change your artefacts a bit.</p>
<p>Play some chris.</p>
<p>I want to put it we want to text red put it in crit damage right because that's just silly.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>Ok so she needs f*** the police.</p>
<p>Set damage their 20.2 that's not bad.</p>
<p>Yeah she's got 13.6% that would probably be better off being crit damage do we have any f*** the police on us.</p>
<p>Spare.</p>
<p>That's being added to the new.</p>
<p>Strong boxes.</p>
<p>We just need to change this for a quick damage piece.</p>
<p>What's right now so we can just give it anything that's crit damage there you go that would literally do it.</p>
<p>Oh my god will you stop moaning.</p>
<p>Go on so much.</p>
<p>Lady like.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Chris.</p>
<p>Oh my god will you shut up.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>A little bit of energy recharge.</p>
<p>Oh my I swear to god you are so annoying all these characters are signed I just never shut up.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>How do you recharge again it could have been worse right could it be an hp.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I spoke.</p>
<p>Can we get one crit race.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Not even one.</p>
<p>Not even one role of correct race a serious.</p>
<p>Crit race.</p>
<p>Jesus lord christ.</p>
<p>3.5% but where does that put a.</p>
<p>Are you still looking really good like anything over 50%.</p>
<p>I'll do for now but we can do better.</p>
<p>We got nothing on that there's no crit on that.</p>
<p>That's got 15.5% crit damage.</p>
<p>Let's see what we can get if we farm some.</p>
<p>F*** the police how do we find how do we find where this door man is.</p>
<p>How the frick do we find the artefact.</p>
<p>It's not that one.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Galaxy see if we can get like something better for a i've tried a lot to get something better for her to be honest.</p>
<p>I found so many of these ridiculous.</p>
<p>You know what I should have.</p>
<p>It's more efficient but having said that.</p>
<p>We still need to do domains seven more times so if we do the low cost runs.</p>
<p>You know we can do more with less resin basically.</p>
<p>So it's probably maybe it's a good thing.</p>
<p>Yeah she's doing much better now.</p>
<p>31 b****.</p>
<p>Will do the condensed first.</p>
<p>Ok we got a moustache.</p>
<p>It's attack.</p>
<p>It has got crip rates.</p>
<p>Entry damage substance.</p>
<p>Play that's the one that can be it's not actually maybe it's that one.</p>
<p>Surplus.</p>
<p>Nothing else will work.</p>
<p>I'm just going to spend all my energy in here.</p>
<p>And i'm happy to do it.</p>
<p>I'm happy to do it with normal resin because.</p>
<p>So it's whatever.</p>
<p>No quit damage.</p>
<p>Bristol has a role.</p>
<p>Let me get my volume b****.</p>
<p>You've got two.</p>
<p>Dendro damage bonus.</p>
<p>Which is quite nice.</p>
<p>Moustache script damage come on.</p>
<p>Can hp.</p>
<p>Defense.</p>
<p>To be honest.</p>
<p>At last.</p>
<p>Ok 49 so we just need 1000 more.</p>
<p>1995 95 more.</p>
<p>Battle pass xp.</p>
<p>Give me a 530 so then we just need like 470 and with maxed out.</p>
<p>Mine tonight and we'll get from dispatch.</p>
<p>Yeah let's do commissions to break it up.</p>
<p>Are we did them.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>There's the commissions will do dispatch now which gives us.</p>
<p>Dispatch gives us our mining.</p>
<p>Turn items.</p>
<p>Do I want to condense the resin i've got I don't know I don't know what i'm doing with it.</p>
<p>So there we go we just need like 470 xp.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>470 explain remaster.</p>
<p>Which I think we'll just get from daly's tomorrow it's probably for the best.</p>
<p>I'm getting I think about.</p>
<p>Five holes from doing the strimmer event I think.</p>
<p>Don't we get 20 pulls for the anniversary.</p>
<p>5 from the shop barista.</p>
<p>Ok let's have a look at.</p>
<p>We didn't get a single sons.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>Let's play tragic.</p>
<p>Exists exists.</p>
<p>I mean it doesn't expire.</p>
<p>Until after the update.</p>
<p>6 days.</p>
<p>It's got 11 days on it.</p>
<p>So I feel like it would be better I mean i've got 16 fragiles though.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>How much am I going to need extra resin during that alarm.</p>
<p>I still feel like i'd rather save it for not allowing to.</p>
<p>I just I can't believe how unlucky.</p>
<p>I think I would say that in the 4 years of playing a scam I don't think i've ever.</p>
<p>Add so much trouble building a character as nadia but not because she's a pain in the ass to build just because like I just cannot get good pieces from the store man.</p>
<p>I don't even know how many how long i've done so many attempts at getting a better pieces it's ridiculous.</p>
<p>And it just will not drop anything decent for me.</p>
<p>Last attempt.</p>
<p>Condensed drop.</p>
<p>Should be double.</p>
<p>I think i've had like two.</p>
<p>I'd like to crit damage men stats on this in the gardeners how many times.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Just get out of my sight.</p>
<p>We don't have this is a strong box yet do we.</p>
<p>I guess i'll just do that.</p>
<p>Is it kraft.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>So i'll just i'll try this or whatever because like the it's just not dropping it for me.</p>
<p>Right so we stuck with this.</p>
<p>This is 20.2 crit damage on a.</p>
<p>I saw one with chris damaged let's see how it rolls did they.</p>
<p>Where the hell are these pieces.</p>
<p>Where are the good pieces.</p>
<p>This is so tragic.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>One trip race.</p>
<p>Want to talk.</p>
<p>Oh my god the pain and suffering.</p>
<p>A pig could also fly past my window.</p>
<p>Oh my.</p>
<p>Are you actually seeing this.</p>
<p>Are you actually seeing this wow.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Just wow.</p>
<p>Just wow what else can you say.</p>
<p>This is just.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Geo damage the odds of getting nothing geo damage bonus.</p>
<p>So basically all the energy right just went absolutely nowhere we didn't get a single usable piece.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>Absolute trash.</p>
<p>We got absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>There's just no point.</p>
<p>So we got we got nothing.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing not a single usable piece.</p>
<p>Not a single usable piece.</p>
<p>How do you know maybe they just don't fly in front of you.</p>
<p>Maybe they're too shy to fly.</p>
<p>I don't need any of those so that's basically it then there's nothing there's nothing to do.</p>
<p>Is it going to work for tomorrow to max the bottle pass.</p>
<p>There isn't even an event.</p>
<p>Yep there's absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>The level of the world level the better.</p>
<p>Anything I could do is have a look at the new.</p>
<p>7 phantom light missing exploration from from here.</p>
<p>Is there any area of an 100%.</p>
<p>What's tomorrow alarm.</p>
<p>We'll have a quick run around.</p>
<p>I don't know that I will find anything do I need let me think about this.</p>
<p>Right question one.</p>
<p>Do I have any leo air compressors.</p>
<p>I have 572 geo sigils for some strange reason.</p>
<p>Add 21 million mile right now.</p>
<p>Price.</p>
<p>Where are compasses.</p>
<p>Search for nearby jocular.</p>
<p>Any single use they must be single use then.</p>
<p>Yeah the compass is malta you so I should have a geo compass ok.</p>
<p>I'm going to pick a chain.</p>
<p>I don't have scenery but I realised if I got scenario I wouldn't use him anywhere.</p>
<p>There's no point in getting him really i'll probably get him at some point anyway.</p>
<p>Are you still alive.</p>
<p>Do you mean.</p>
<p>She's not very good you know.</p>
<p>But I know dear fans were not happy about how trashy was.</p>
<p>I say.</p>
<p>Why can't I change.</p>
<p>You missed out you've already missed out.</p>
<p>The best thing in the game.</p>
<p>Are you f****** t*** I have to pick that first.</p>
<p>You already missed out on the best thing in the game.</p>
<p>Because during the last anniversary.</p>
<p>You didn't get this did you which is basically the best thing in the game.</p>
<p>I mean how is not that how is that not the best thing in the game.</p>
<p>Will you wally b****.</p>
<p>Where is he.</p>
<p>What's attacking me.</p>
<p>How do I get up there.</p>
<p>All I have to do make a return before 5.0 is the open is open the app work for the up to download.</p>
<p>Ok well that's weird because it's saying.</p>
<p>I got one of these.</p>
<p>When it's in the right place at lines up.</p>
<p>What the hell so which way around what the f***.</p>
<p>Do you know where that goes there.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>I do not understand.</p>
<p>It feels like none of them are actually lining up.</p>
<p>Has any imaginary would let you keep doing this if you already solve the problem now.</p>
<p>I don't know i'm confused.</p>
<p>Is the chest beneath me.</p>
<p>The quran.</p>
<p>Awards.</p>
<p>That's hilarious though because you can't even play it on mobile.</p>
<p>The game stop bugs you can't put on mobile but it wins mobile game awards.</p>
<p>Best visuals if you can get it to run.</p>
<p>So how the hell do I get underneath this.</p>
<p>How the hell do you get underneath this.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't really see a way to get.</p>
<p>Cancel alarm.</p>
<p>I need to go higher.</p>
<p>Has a chest there but I don't think that's the one that was.</p>
<p>Telegraph to me.</p>
<p>Veronica do this quicker.</p>
<p>You can walk on water.</p>
<p>Why are you going little s***.</p>
<p>I can't use socks.</p>
<p>I can't use for in a scale.</p>
<p>Ok I wonder if I can.</p>
<p>Zip it zippy zippy zipper.</p>
<p>So if I playsets.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Is that the one that moves the.</p>
<p>This is quite annoying.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>How long do we actually get.</p>
<p>I can use these.</p>
<p>Right so if i.</p>
<p>Suck it to this.</p>
<p>Suck it to the.</p>
<p>Where the hell is this one that's down.</p>
<p>It's even lower than where I am now how the hell are you meant to get underneath this land.</p>
<p>Ok so this needs one of those building things that you can pick up.</p>
<p>Provident fully understand the mechanics before.</p>
<p>-100%.</p>
<p>How speed doing maybe.</p>
<p>Alarm me to share a secret I buried a few rather nice things in the corner of the flower.</p>
<p>Oh my god it's just there.</p>
<p>It was there the whole time.</p>
<p>Good guard.</p>
<p>Play treasure did not compass did not find any nearby treasure.</p>
<p>So I guess we probably clear this area then.</p>
<p>I just saw something as well behind me.</p>
<p>Get these first there we go.</p>
<p>Update what the hell.</p>
<p>And he's always gonna be really really strong.</p>
<p>So it depends if you don't have strong teams right now and you kind of like you need the utility I would probably say kaza haha.</p>
<p>Put me personally I like the waifu characters so.</p>
<p>Looks fun.</p>
<p>What are we doing now you know what I got i've been I got sore distracted because I saw one of those exploration points.</p>
<p>How many do I need to get.</p>
<p>Get all of them.</p>
<p>This is not good.</p>
<p>Weather.</p>
<p>Awkward.</p>
<p>Ok just use that.</p>
<p>Go to that one.</p>
<p>Pubs itself out I have no idea why.</p>
<p>The weather original weather originally channels challenge thing was there was one of those exploration points that I missed and I saw it and I thought should I do should I get that first I get it last I should have got it first because the first challenge thing took me on a massive detour.</p>
<p>What's this.</p>
<p>So dancing beneath the autumn moon sorry song and incessant signals.</p>
<p>That's the one I want thank you.</p>
<p>Are you might be over here.</p>
<p>Where is the exploration point.</p>
<p>What does glowing things down there.</p>
<p>Is yellow glaze.</p>
<p>When did this one.</p>
<p>I can't get it from the wilder.</p>
<p>Get the crystal flies.</p>
<p>How is sure I did this already.</p>
<p>I like are they set it up so that the cryo slime creates a path for you that's quite cool.</p>
<p>Frozen cats.</p>
<p>Carefree simulator on as being stored to its original position.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know whether it's that or not.</p>
<p>Call ria.</p>
<p>Where did it say did not find anything I did not find any.</p>
<p>And now we're down by the dark.</p>
<p>What is with the dogs.</p>
<p>That's very odd.</p>
<p>Can I put my finger on up.</p>
<p>But it's freaking me out.</p>
<p>Wouldn't have you have been the ideal person for this thing.</p>
<p>Has apparently immune.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm seriously at my limit I think with this toothache.</p>
<p>Like most what if you've already got a dentist that's fine because you've already got a dentist right so you might be like well why don't I have a dentist cuz i'm.</p>
<p>Down south to exeter.</p>
<p>Covid being covid.</p>
<p>How to move back here which is where I was born.</p>
<p>The countries like in a state right now where they're just none of the dentists are.</p>
<p>Over capacity or whatever.</p>
<p>And of course it just so happens that I have more teeth problems I never really had teeth problems with magic my own fault I just kind of like got depressed and stop looking after them to be honest.</p>
<p>Answer yeah it's like all great wow.</p>
<p>And so i've had like teeth fall out.</p>
<p>Is very painful.</p>
<p>I've had infections.</p>
<p>And what tends to happen is it doesn't hurt when it comes out but then a couple of days later it tends to like.</p>
<p>Stream and talk and.</p>
<p>Earlier thinking and coding and stuff it's a challenge.</p>
<p>It's a challenge.</p>
<p>Please yeah and like I mean how long have I been streaming for now like 5 1/2 hours yet so like that you know 5 1/2 hours later i'm actually going to headache with the pen as well like the it's like the it feels like the pan as nickel to help me for so long right here inside of my mouth that it feels at this point like it's just spread to my call head.</p>
<p>Michael had is hurting me.</p>
<p>But the majority of the pen is.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p>10:20 if I can.</p>
<p>Change the pants on how.</p>
<p>Play I mean battle pass is max tomorrow.</p>
<p>That last bit of xp.</p>
