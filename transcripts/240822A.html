<h3>From Live stream on Thursday 22-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfyd6SKHOZA​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfyd6SKHOZA​</a></h3>
<p>Good morning indeed.</p>
<p>Says go away.</p>
<p>Roadworks in progress.</p>
<p>Potholes galore they'll be some.</p>
<p>Bug holes probably.</p>
<p>Do a sponsored highlands stream or something I don't know that feels like it would be.</p>
<p>All right so boo was working I ran him all day.</p>
<p>Is that who it is is it.</p>
<p>Saran pcbuilder in the editor and he was absolutely fine but he's been disappearing the build now if he continues to do that i'm going to need to find interesting where's the debug so that can be a tutorial.</p>
<p>So ok let's we'll keep an eye on pc boo.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think did I put.</p>
<p>I don't think I put much 3 in new minigames yet but I need to put much 3 in new mini games I guess because that's.</p>
<p>The right pipeline.</p>
<p>But I don't know let me think about this.</p>
<p>The mini games don't have to use that pipeline.</p>
<p>So I think yeah ok I think the match 3 is in play compile mini games.</p>
<p>Because that was still using hdrp.</p>
<p>The reason we can't use hdrp.</p>
<p>The reason we we moved out of hdrp was because you can't do hdrp web builds.</p>
<p>And I do want a web copy of it but I don't know it's like do I just make them standard pipeline anyway I guess it's probably easier the original my plan was ok.</p>
<p>So the first game was the mini game which I started building in pyramid because I thought well it will be an arcade machine in poundland.</p>
<p>Which is what I did.</p>
<p>Yeah we were working on it in here is this hdrp.</p>
<p>How can I tell look at the materials.</p>
<p>Hdrp only affects materials and if you've got north 3d graphics.</p>
<p>Wouldn't really be using hdrp but i'm going to go ahead and guess that this wouldn't do a web build.</p>
<p>I need to figure out what i'm doing I really need to figure this out because this kid end up being a lot more work for myself if I don't.</p>
<p>Figure this out early.</p>
<p>I think for the mini games it probably makes sense to do everything in standard render pipeline because it's not like you need super duper like cyberpunk graphics for mini games anywhere and then we can do the web builds we can do the unique builds.</p>
<p>And then we've also got a mini game with them all together because my issue was.</p>
<p>At some point I want a release like a game that's that's just like play compile many games and that will have all of the mini games in it so you can download that and play it and it'll just like we'll come up with like a little interface you know like those little those little bundles you can buy that I like I don't know sick I make a drive classics or whatever sort of something like that that has the more than one.</p>
<p>But in order to do that it makes sense to build the mini games.</p>
<p>Together in one big bundle and then just sort of build out the individual components as individual mini games.</p>
<p>Raven tried to take all the mini games.</p>
<p>Finish and then try and stuff them all in the one compilation.</p>
<p>Could be a bit messy.</p>
<p>If I build them within the compilation and then build out each individual one and then I can build the whole thing together as one big.</p>
<p>Ok so what pipeline are we in.</p>
<p>Materials for this game because it's all sprites.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>Graphics.</p>
<p>Yes ok this is.</p>
<p>Okay this this is play compile minigames.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So I think what I need to do now.</p>
<p>Is mega prefabs folder there's already one.</p>
<p>Make a prefab of the match 3 scene.</p>
<p>I made a standard render pipeline which I think was new minigames which is why called a new mini games let's load that one that should be standard run a pipeline I think that should have a fully web.</p>
<p>Play compatible build of finch ball in it.</p>
<p>So we need to build time on robert in.</p>
<p>How can I tell this one should have a special yeah there it is controls a special little hint which tells you how to control the game so I know that's the correct version just a double trouble whatever check if we got a project settings graphics it should now said built-in.</p>
<p>Where is non render pipeline I said so this is definitely the standard render pipeline ok so what we what we can do from here is 7 new scene.</p>
<p>How do you make a new seen today.</p>
<p>New scene.</p>
<p>Empty save this one.</p>
<p>Save us.</p>
<p>Scenes.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Then in my prefabs folder if I go to the.</p>
<p>Give me a second.</p>
<p>Play compile many games I think it's called.</p>
<p>Assets prefabs march 330.</p>
<p>Grab the child components and stick it on the original scene.</p>
<p>Delete scene.</p>
<p>Remove seen save.</p>
<p>Now when we pull the assets in.</p>
<p>Should be good but what I want to do is try to organise this because.</p>
<p>Ok so the the problem with the way i'm about to do it.</p>
<p>What you end up with is let's save them 20 minigames right you have 20 mini games worth of assets in your project and then you build out you want to build out one mini game.</p>
<p>You could potentially if you weren't careful I guess although I say unit.</p>
<p>Unity checks the build to see what it needs and.</p>
<p>There's no real risk my original thought was then you could end up with like you know 20 games worth.</p>
<p>Mini game assets for only one of the mini games so you mini games going to be 20 times bigger than it needs to be but like I say unit is actually quite good.</p>
<p>I've seen I don't I don't think it does include anything that doesn't need to be included.</p>
<p>But I still feel like it's better to be organised so that you can separate these out so you can say ok these are for finish ball these are for whatever whatever.</p>
<p>Ok so I think.</p>
<p>What I want to do.</p>
<p>So what will have is will have some assets to like global assets right that apply to all mini games in a good example of that would be the music player script and all of the music that I imported.</p>
<p>Games.</p>
<p>Or anything else and also the play compile logo that comes up at the start but anything else.</p>
<p>An input things like input system action assets I don't know even those might be different depending on the game actually.</p>
<p>Fish bowl.</p>
<p>I want to put the finch bolt assets in the finch bolt folder.</p>
<p>So we wouldn't include import we wouldn't include models we wouldn't include scenes scripts are specific to this.</p>
<p>Sketchfab for unity is the plug-in and ui is specific to this so the only folders that really applies is models scripts in the ui so if I just drag and drop those into french bowl.</p>
<p>Now we have like separation of assets which is quite nice.</p>
<p>And i'm just going to make a new folder.</p>
<p>I'm going to call it match 3.</p>
<p>See this getting a bit.</p>
<p>So actually what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>I'm going to make one called game assets.</p>
<p>I'm going to put doors as folders with.</p>
<p>What about sausage ball and match 3 going a game.</p>
<p>That makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Ok now the important thing now though I think is we don't want to add match 3 assets to the match 3 folder just yet because I think the prefabs going to be looking for the minor original places so that's why I wanted to make move everything to finish ball now because this is another reason to do this right is let's say I have.</p>
<p>Let me think so.</p>
<p>It was in the play compile.</p>
<p>What's 3.</p>
<p>And a ui folder called match 3 I guess.</p>
<p>And did I make a models for and it doesn't use any models because there's no 3d assets.</p>
<p>Ask out of annoying.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>I just decided to do it one way originally and i'm doing a different way.</p>
<p>No biggie.</p>
<p>So which ones that one that is the original one.</p>
<p>Assets show and explorer this is the new one.</p>
<p>Assets I get so I can just copy.</p>
<p>What is a urine script.</p>
<p>Fool what I should have done actually looking at it I should have I should have brought the assets over first and then started organising them how many days.</p>
<p>We know where they live.</p>
<p>It should be fine.</p>
<p>Ui.</p>
<p>Those are the ones that have the sub.</p>
<p>What's the we need.</p>
<p>Yeah now I get some errors that's a normal because.</p>
<p>Folder.</p>
<p>Stop snowing.</p>
<p>What you are.</p>
<p>And then i'll match three scripts.</p>
<p>We can move to.</p>
<p>We can just grab.</p>
<p>Grab the match 3 will should do this right.</p>
<p>Captain march 3 folder and put it in match 3.</p>
<p>Make something harder than it needs to be never happened before.</p>
<p>You must be confusing me with somebody else.</p>
<p>Yes I know I do manage to do this to myself tonight.</p>
<p>It's a gift right not necessarily want anyone wants so you are is going to need to be renamed to ui and will stick it in much 3 so it follows the same pattern as the other one.</p>
<p>Am I happy with that I mean.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>I only see one.</p>
<p>You can see it's looking good right.</p>
<p>So now we're working with new mini games.</p>
<p>Yeah i've got to get this down because i'm going to get incredibly confused.</p>
<p>Especially if i.</p>
<p>Comes out and I don't do anything with it for like.</p>
<p>Which food is it.</p>
<p>Yeah I need to future proof my idiocy.</p>
<p>Against my ac where we get the same errors namespace global namespace already contains a definition for renommer.</p>
<p>Now that sounds like I have two resident emma scripts in the project which I may well do now.</p>
<p>I had a look and I it's not where I would have expected it to be.</p>
<p>Yes I do have two residents where's that one.</p>
<p>Asset scripts assets games football I looked for that I couldn't find that one right now since resident is shot for resource remover.</p>
<p>And it's a tool that remains.</p>
<p>The idea here is let's say I wanted to collab with somebody and somebody was like.</p>
<p>Dower from hollywood that's a pretty nice looking pain on march 3 game you've got going on there you don't mind if i.</p>
<p>You don't mind if I jump in with and do a little fiddling with that dear i'll be late first of all don't talk about pain on like that and i'd be like secondly yeah sure but I don't want you to have access to my other games so the idea is with this project set up the way that i'm setting it up is I could just go into all the other games that aren't you know a match 3 delete them from game assets and then send him that and he's only got what he needs them.</p>
<p>So this ui folder wants to be global ui.</p>
<p>Which is strange because i'm not seeing any glue I know I do have global ui so where the hell did it all go.</p>
<p>Is the question.</p>
<p>That should have my play compile logo in and whatnot right there's also two.</p>
<p>There's two bootstrap scripts.</p>
<p>But I like to normally come on sort of 10:00 ish.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>What's going on.</p>
<p>Bootstrap out of finch ball.</p>
<p>It sounds like.</p>
<p>What's happened is.</p>
<p>The global stuff went in.</p>
<p>Change fall.</p>
<p>Global assets stuff.</p>
<p>I want to grab those put them in ui there's a global script so we can put it in scripts and actually just to make it super.</p>
<p>Silently.</p>
<p>Set the fbi finally found you.</p>
<p>But you love to fight another day.</p>
<p>Is boo showing up still.</p>
<p>Index was out of range.</p>
<p>No reference for the first thing we get is a null reference because it doesn't know what the input action map is now this is what I was talking about input action maps do not necessarily match.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Well you know as long as everything's good.</p>
<p>Right on enable.</p>
<p>So input action.</p>
<p>Now I need to think about this so there are two ways to solve this.</p>
<p>I need I need to compare both ways of doing it in my head.</p>
<p>What if we could.</p>
<p>We could have separate input action maps.</p>
<p>For each game.</p>
<p>Change them on the fly.</p>
<p>Could get difficult to manage.</p>
<p>What we could do is we could copy the mappings.</p>
<p>Per game and have one mapping to rule them all essentially.</p>
<p>I think in a weirdo that could be even more problematic.</p>
<p>It depends what kind of mini games I do.</p>
<p>Unique and weird controls and we need to do some weird and interesting things with the input system that would somewhat limit us on a per game basis so I think I think the first option is the better way of doing it to have separate input action maps per game and then we can change them on the fly I think that's a better way of doing it.</p>
<p>So what i'll do is i'll make.</p>
<p>I'll make a folder called input marks.</p>
<p>Right so i've got input maps.</p>
<p>So given match 3 is saying.</p>
<p>Try to run it and it's screaming about the introduction map i'm going to assume.</p>
<p>One we have in here is for finch ball so let's go back to finish ball and run it and see if it runs.</p>
<p>If this runs then we know this is the action map for finish call.</p>
<p>Yeah it does.</p>
<p>I don't think you would have.</p>
<p>Input maps.</p>
<p>And then what i'm going to do is in input maps i'm going to find match threes input map.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Probably an input actions file isn't it yet it's probably that one there input system.</p>
<p>Input actions so i'm going to grab this input system input actions.</p>
<p>I want to put it in there and i'm going to call it.</p>
<p>Mastery.</p>
<p>So there's the match three input mapping.</p>
<p>Cervical back to the match 3 game.</p>
<p>And see.</p>
<p>Where did we link that.</p>
<p>Right there it is input.</p>
<p>Missing input action assets ok so let's run it now.</p>
<p>Yeah I know I know where the trailer is.</p>
<p>Is that the trailer you're leaking right it's still saying it can't find it's it's saying it can't find.</p>
<p>Some of the input actions.</p>
<p>Ok the match 3 input actions looks.</p>
<p>Suspiciously like.</p>
<p>The finch ball input actions I think it is ok so I need to delete that input actions that we copied the wrong one that isn't the correct in productions.</p>
<p>What the hell is it then.</p>
<p>It should be dot input actions.</p>
<p>Inconsistent.</p>
<p>How do we get the c sharp scripture.</p>
<p>Will it do that to sell if I wonder.</p>
<p>There we go that's correct.</p>
<p>Can we go back here.</p>
<p>We sign it here.</p>
<p>Ok it's right now.</p>
<p>I will back to where we were.</p>
<p>Which is correct.</p>
<p>Best ethan sorry we'll wait until everything we know that everything is good I think everything is good.</p>
<p>Yeah okay so now we have a project that is standard render pipeline.</p>
<p>So we should be good.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's weird it's working now.</p>
<p>That is so weird.</p>
<p>Was this a unity 6 bog.</p>
<p>Remember when I was struggling to get the food to to actually throw up time in london payment and I could not get it to work only the first object would land so what I was going to do is try and do is trick the system and I was going to try and make clones of each thriller and have one throw up her food item and see if it would throw it's food correctly there watch it it works now.</p>
<p>Volume 86 bug.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Good lord ok unit 6 really isn't ready for.</p>
<p>Production is it.</p>
<p>How many really bad bugs that has it has issues with colitis triggers.</p>
<p>Movements like oh my god like some of the fundamental systems that could just completely busted as hell it's a shame because I do like the direction unit 6 is going in but my god so it's bugs like.</p>
<p>The worst i've ever seen ok so I will throw.</p>
<p>Add it's in my recommended and I can I can watch the trailer.</p>
<p>Say I do want to watch it right there we go so literally it's that accurate so obviously now that we have that much accuracy over we want it to go into time on his mouth so now I can literally put it on time on mouth.</p>
<p>And it goes right into a mouth perfect.</p>
<p>Oh my god that works so well.</p>
<p>I can't believe i'm buggered it is.</p>
<p>That is crazy.</p>
<p>Yeah that's crazy actually.</p>
<p>Perfect so that's what we wanted right so that the next step.</p>
<p>So we'll take the throw objects out the whole point of this no I don't know whether the clicking is working let's have a look.</p>
<p>The whole point of this was to once we make the match right.</p>
<p>The whole point was to have the food thrown so if we move this burger up here yeah that's working woohoo we got too much is and all the food went the next thing we have to do is get rid of that food oh my god this is so good.</p>
<p>How's the consoles yeah that seems to all be working now.</p>
<p>Oh my god it just goes to show.</p>
<p>Sometimes like just by using like the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>Release how much.</p>
<p>Extra pain.</p>
<p>Quiet in the class.</p>
<p>Are you making noise are you following along.</p>
<p>Right so the next stage is to remove that food as it gets thrown.</p>
<p>So we should see and hear somewhere.</p>
<p>Where are we reference the throne.</p>
<p>She was a while ago when I last worked on this.</p>
<p>Another unity book.</p>
<p>We get it in this version of you and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>Add food squares right so that's where we put.</p>
<p>Food squares start index.</p>
<p>+ iteration index game object.</p>
<p>Right we add you can see each item of food that we add to the throne.</p>
<p>Can we get the game object itself to be thrown.</p>
<p>At the time on.</p>
<p>Sell backgrounds.</p>
<p>Is what colours the cell backgrounds to highlight the food that's the wrong.</p>
<p>Right so that's in a control called sell backgrounds.</p>
<p>It should be the food squares I believe that has the food items in it so essentially what we want to do is on the food.</p>
<p>On the food squares.</p>
<p>The next thing we need to do is set the food square texture to empty.</p>
<p>On each of those food squares.</p>
<p>So if we set food squares starting decks.</p>
<p>Plus iteration index.</p>
<p>Dot texture.</p>
<p>Equals and we should have a food type.</p>
<p>Food types I think it's actually food type.</p>
<p>Let's check.</p>
<p>Some gear manager.</p>
<p>Get managers on canvas.</p>
<p>Scam.</p>
<p>Our food is stored.</p>
<p>Are food is stored here.</p>
<p>On the food parent.</p>
<p>Prince all interesting.</p>
<p>Ok we don't have a food type known that we can pull this texture from which is a bit of an issue.</p>
<p>How should I go about doing this I might just store the food type none on the game manager.</p>
<p>The food type nan texture.</p>
<p>Texture equals empty texture.</p>
<p>Ok so we can match that burger there.</p>
<p>Okay a few things happened.</p>
<p>The food did disappear but it didn't.</p>
<p>Get thrown up time on I think I know why I think we made the food invisible and then through invisible food at pyramid.</p>
<p>We didn't know we didn't do in that order so it shouldn't really have done that.</p>
<p>It did take the textures out.</p>
<p>Ok let's do that again.</p>
<p>And keep our eye on the throne and just see if that is what's happening.</p>
<p>So remove the fries to there.</p>
<p>We have different code for horizontal and vertical these were vertical matches so the vertical matches are running the same chord that they were before.</p>
<p>Disappear.</p>
<p>So I need to essentially I need to make a horizontal match.</p>
<p>We also have a bug right now where.</p>
<p>What it's doing on the subsequent matches is it matching everything that was matched previously along with the next march so the first set of freeze that it matched vertically it included that in the match this time around and the reason why magic that'll be fixed when we when we clean things up yeah the reason why is because our game logic basically scans the board and looks for matches and it finds those matches and says there you go you matched all this there's your points there's there's the food so it is working as intended but obviously we don't want it to work like that.</p>
<p>Turn it down a bit louder.</p>
<p>Obviously when it's finished.</p>
<p>We don't want it to do that so the way I will fix that as well just clean up the board so that doesn't happen right so interesting so the food is being made invisible.</p>
<p>The guests are onto paimon which is weird.</p>
<p>I'll tell you why that's weird.</p>
<p>Because what we do is we cloned the object.</p>
<p>So when when the throat receives the object it claims the object.</p>
<p>So it doesn't actually throw the original object because the original object needs to stand itself.</p>
<p>Now what should be happening is it should be cloning the food item with the food item icon in it.</p>
<p>Instead what seems to be having.</p>
<p>Is by the time the food store gets it the foods already become invisible.</p>
<p>Oh yes I suppose it would ok and yeah now that I think about it I know why ok I can tell you why that's happening actually.</p>
<p>So we spin this up and it's on call routine right so it goes off it doesn't really make a new thread but essentially it creates new allocation time.</p>
<p>Single threaded.</p>
<p>Play unity will allocate time for each like.</p>
<p>So essentially it will complete this entire structure.</p>
<p>This structure has made the food invisible so how do we fix that it's dead simple.</p>
<p>All we do.</p>
<p>And we know that every single loop happens once every frame lube right.</p>
<p>The easy way to fix this is just to say.</p>
<p>Yield.</p>
<p>Turn new weight for end of frame.</p>
<p>What does what does essentially.</p>
<p>Who is this going to tell unity lock when you get to this line stop this structure give all the other structures their turn and then on the next frame you can continue where you left off so unit will do that unity will say ok I need to let everything else get a turn now and then i'll do this bit here so this will allow our object through a turn.</p>
<p>And then but now our objects were I should have.</p>
<p>Invisible squares to throw up.</p>
<p>So we'll do these drinks.</p>
<p>Oh that didn't.</p>
<p>Yes interesting.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>How to fix update is what we want.</p>
<p>Maybe i'm confusing friends with fixed updates.</p>
<p>It's quite possible.</p>
<p>Animation where she kind of like eats that.</p>
<p>So the one book we got.</p>
<p>If we look closely.</p>
<p>Is we were showing ghost freeze who scary.</p>
<p>Showing ghost freeze over the burger.</p>
<p>A little bit more alpha.</p>
<p>Not sure why.</p>
<p>You see that again.</p>
<p>Why are we making ghost foods.</p>
<p>I think I don't know I can't remember that I would like to say it was a while ago and I worked on this I think maybe what's supposed to be happening is right now as you can see me moving the mouse around.</p>
<p>I think we're supposed to be drawing the ghost freeze.</p>
<p>To sort of hint to the player that these this is where the fries are going to move to.</p>
<p>Instead.</p>
<p>Also did that change.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>The pizza should go over there right.</p>
<p>What leaves the ghost pizza.</p>
<p>In the stage before it.</p>
<p>To show where the food's going to go.</p>
<p>Yeah it's mostly working.</p>
<p>We're leaving a ghost.</p>
<p>Behind where the original item was and that must be happening after.</p>
<p>The move has been made which is weird.</p>
<p>Ok so we've got two lines to add in the vertical after the throw gets given the food.</p>
<p>Which is the yield return new at fire fixed update.</p>
<p>After giving the throw the food.</p>
<p>And then to change the texture to the empty texture.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>Ghost food so how do we debug the ghost food well.</p>
<p>Is the problem when you come back to.</p>
<p>Is meant to be applied.</p>
<p>Right so we have grab food and placed food.</p>
<p>So good foods texture is food type grabbed food image and the colour should be set to ghost on.</p>
<p>When grub index is negative 1.</p>
<p>Index negative 1 is that we've grabbed the food.</p>
<p>Replace the food if grab indexes anything other than negative 1.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about that is.</p>
<p>The only time I see the ghost food.</p>
<p>The only time I see the ghost food is after we place the food which is not what it's supposed to be happening so the first thing we need to check is is our grub index.</p>
<p>Is there a grab index.</p>
<p>State machine working correctly.</p>
<p>So the first thing to check is can we see it is it is it exposed any inspector.</p>
<p>Yes it is we can see it right there -1 good stuff ok so we can keep an eye on that so let's check that and see if it's working correctly so as far as I can tell grab index.</p>
<p>Is -1.</p>
<p>What's the bus.</p>
<p>If grab index.</p>
<p>Is -1 which it is.</p>
<p>Then ghost food plaza = true.</p>
<p>Will that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Make a logically.</p>
<p>As opposed to a footballer.</p>
<p>Hand burger I love I love that.</p>
<p>What's hamburger.</p>
<p>What is wrong with me.</p>
<p>As we grabbed this handle burger should turn to negative 1.</p>
<p>Which it did.</p>
<p>I clicked it once and it didn't actually do it but I wonder if maybe it missed the click.</p>
<p>What's my.</p>
<p>Maybe you can't see this because my camera's in the way.</p>
<p>Oh my god this thing is so broken.</p>
<p>Driving next is negative 1 now.</p>
<p>Wow that's the weird part.</p>
<p>This grab index makes no sense it's grabbing this is not working correctly I don't think.</p>
<p>We are able to grab food.</p>
<p>It's so long that I built this that I can't remember.</p>
<p>25 oh wait a minute.</p>
<p>No I remember now.</p>
<p>Okay I think I know what's happening i'm confusing what grabbing because I thought grabbing dicks was a step machine but it's not it's an index reference.</p>
<p>So negative 1 means we aren't grabbing any food right now yes ok that makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Because index is coming from zero right so what are essentially done is i've said look if the graphics is negative one it means nothing is selected.</p>
<p>Is anything from zero or not is an actual index number it's like a valid index number.</p>
<p>Essentially negative one is just saying we do not have the player does not have not grabbed any food as of yet.</p>
<p>So when I when I grab these fries it'll change to whatever index that was so change to 25.</p>
<p>Index number.</p>
<p>Ok so now we should be seeing the ghost food.</p>
<p>But we're not.</p>
<p>Yeah but the grab index does seem to be working there.</p>
<p>And then when grabbing deck goes back to negative one that's where we see the grabbed food index.</p>
<p>Food affect but we see it in the.</p>
<p>Ok interesting.</p>
<p>So my my logic says if grab index is negative 1.</p>
<p>Yeah this is not right at all.</p>
<p>I think this should basically sir if grub index is greater than -1.</p>
<p>Yeah I think it's just a simple a simple logic mistake that I made yeah I said absolute equals I should have said greater than.</p>
<p>Ok I got an argument out of range exception.</p>
<p>Argument out of range exception.</p>
<p>Ok so this is basically also I just noticed this is only if input confirm was pressed this frame so as.</p>
<p>Ok so not yet jesus christ.</p>
<p>If the player presses to grab the food.</p>
<p>And there is currently nothing in the grab index.</p>
<p>Absolute equals -1 is correct.</p>
<p>Show ghost placements.</p>
<p>Function.</p>
<p>With an integer of food item.</p>
<p>For each raw image sell in ghost foods.</p>
<p>Turn all cells.</p>
<p>Colour to ghost off.</p>
<p>Should we also change the ghost foods.</p>
<p>We should be saying ghost foods.</p>
<p>Texture equals.</p>
<p>Empty texture.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>It's starting to work but this this ghost food thing is.</p>
<p>Definitely not working.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess we don't need to change the food to an empty texture for ghost off because essentially what I did is I set ghost off colour to just be completely invisible.</p>
<p>Do we have an if ghost closer is true.</p>
<p>Also this is if ghost placer if ghost food plaza is.</p>
<p>False highlight current sell borders else.</p>
<p>Pleasures true.</p>
<p>Then show ghost.</p>
<p>Placement.</p>
<p>Should we also highlight the current cell bars anyway the weird thing about this is every single.</p>
<p>Part of the chord.</p>
<p>Looks right to me.</p>
<p>It's like it couldn't it couldn't work.</p>
<p>It couldn't not work any harder than it's not working now.</p>
<p>I need to be able to see show ghost plaster as well.</p>
<p>Any inspector for now.</p>
<p>Yeah that's private that needs to be public right now so I can see it.</p>
<p>Show ghost food closer should go to true.</p>
<p>I am stumped.</p>
<p>Everything looks right to me so I have no idea why that's not working that's very odd.</p>
<p>Also is this working because according to this.</p>
<p>Every single move right now would make a match that can't be correct.</p>
<p>Oh my god this freaking game do you know what these these games are freaking hard to put together.</p>
<p>Truth wrong this is actually kind of insanely complicated.</p>
<p>It isn't it's not it's just I think it's just awkward.</p>
<p>It also is it also is kind of.</p>
<p>Not the easiest.</p>
<p>I don't know i'm tempted to i'm tempted to feed this to chat gbt and see if it can share any light on it for me.</p>
<p>What's your chief church ubt you can find anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>That's very large.</p>
<p>I'm having issues with my ghost placement.</p>
<p>System.</p>
<p>When food is grabbed.</p>
<p>It should.</p>
<p>Telegraph.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>With a ghost copy.</p>
<p>To indicate.</p>
<p>Where the food.</p>
<p>Will go.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>It is not showing.</p>
<p>During the grab.</p>
<p>And instead leaves.</p>
<p>Cast.</p>
<p>Behind.</p>
<p>After the match.</p>
<p>Can you see the ed sheeran.</p>
<p>I don't know this is quite a lot.</p>
<p>This year you're facing with the ghost placements appears to be related to the logic handling.</p>
<p>When and where the gloucester image telegraph appears specifically your gosh pleasant function and the way the ghost textures are cleared seem to be causing the ghost to a man behind after much is another pier correctly when grabbing food.</p>
<p>Ok so it's giving me a fix for my if grabbing decks is currently nothing is grabbed.</p>
<p>Which is why is that.</p>
<p>These are these match three games are a lot more.</p>
<p>Challenging that I thought that I thought they would be.</p>
<p>This is definitely not a beginner.</p>
<p>Project.</p>
<p>So I think it's giving me the code for that bit yeah it's give me the code for.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>And also.</p>
<p>If grab index is greater than -1.</p>
<p>Which is desperate here and out.</p>
<p>Play food.</p>
<p>Instead of saying else.</p>
<p>I mean it's the same thing as else really the only time that would do anything different like the only risk of doing an owl's is if it ever goes lower than -1 but it should never go alone - 1.</p>
<p>Can sort of see why it.</p>
<p>My elf was fine like that's not really going to change the way this works so the code within these brackets is probably.</p>
<p>Going to be what helps things.</p>
<p>What iteration index is less than last match count.</p>
<p>Good god this project.</p>
<p>Which one.</p>
<p>Yeah this is my one with the fixed up there as well.</p>
<p>But is it giving me for horizontal is it giving me it for vertical.</p>
<p>I need to know which one it's giving me.</p>
<p>Cast a different.</p>
<p>In the player match coroutine after you update the board and throw objects and shoot any ghost images related to the match cells are cleared.</p>
<p>I need to know if this is horizontal of vertical.</p>
<p>Ok I can see it's giving me horizontal because the structure of my vertical uses an index are called per iteration where is my horizontal matches user a driver of it urgent index.</p>
<p>The problem is.</p>
<p>Whatever this is changing.</p>
<p>What iteration index is less than last match count.</p>
<p>It's defining an integer of matched index.</p>
<p>Would you start index plus iteration ind.</p>
<p>Turn cell backgrounds matched colour colour equals.</p>
<p>Why is it changed well I was doing it I was doing it to start index yeah yeah okay all it's done right ok I see what it's done.</p>
<p>Iteration index is.</p>
<p>Index instead of doing that mathematical functions.</p>
<p>Over and over again.</p>
<p>So that's fine.</p>
<p>We throw a food based off the march index which is the same mathematical calculation yeah it's just basically.</p>
<p>Made it a little bit more human readable which actually ironically confused me cos i'm actually a robot.</p>
<p>Ok so change is all of my maths to matched in the.</p>
<p>I guess makes sense and what is essentially.</p>
<p>Is it added two lines here which is ghost foods at matched index yes just turning them off for I see what it's doing it's setting empty texture and empty car to the ghost foods.</p>
<p>Before we go crazy.</p>
<p>I still don't see the ghost foods.</p>
<p>That broke my entire game.</p>
<p>That actually broke my entire game.</p>
<p>I'm actually losing points right now I have a score of -25 like that couldn't have broken my game more.</p>
<p>Wow thanks chat gbc.</p>
<p>Get the help.</p>
<p>It's completely broken my game ok i'm just going to control that all the way back to what I had because at least my game worked.</p>
<p>Tell me about it.</p>
<p>What was the first bit of chord we changed with this.</p>
<p>I can get the code back from the question that I asked chat gpt cuz I sent I sent chat gpt my entire card so if I want it back I can just.</p>
<p>Get rid of the question and we'll just copy.</p>
<p>Chat gbt.</p>
<p>Like the main game functions are working correctly but that ghost burger shouldn't have been left behind.</p>
<p>And we're not seeing the ghost foods up on like placement telegraphing which is what was supposed to do.</p>
<p>But the main function of the game is working fine it's scarring me correctly.</p>
<p>How much is it to throwing the food at paiman and it's deleting the original food from squares the next step is to drop the food down now into the empty squares to fill those squares and generate new food where they fell from.</p>
<p>But I would kind of like to clear up the ghost foods.</p>
<p>So the only two conditions.</p>
<p>Will there are three conditions we would give a shit about for the ghost placement right what is the grab index which is basically the index the cell index of the food.</p>
<p>Don't we are.</p>
<p>Although that that feels kind of duplicate rice it's a new word I just made up.</p>
<p>Is phil's kind of duplicate.</p>
<p>It feels like an unnecessary because i'm using.</p>
<p>I'm using grab index.</p>
<p>To indicate what food was grab but then I have also got an index called grab the food.</p>
<p>And i'm slightly confused why did I feel the need to have two images there.</p>
<p>Could we not just use grabbed food.</p>
<p>Let me see those numbers and see what happens.</p>
<p>Okay yeah the answer is no.</p>
<p>Because we store.</p>
<p>So we have to store we use grab index to store the index of the food that is essentially about to be grabbed for when we place it.</p>
<p>Grabbed food is zero right now.</p>
<p>I don't know the logically logically I should be able to do that with one index alright.</p>
<p>I don't know because like i'm not to be fair it's not like i'm trying to fix like that part of working so I don't necessarily want to fix what isn't broken I just want to fix what is broken.</p>
<p>And I feel like the property is a reason that I do it that way because i'm normally quite good at stuff like that like i've learnt.</p>
<p>I have learnt not to add more variables than I need because that could be a nightmare so it's always best to try and be as efficient as you can let.</p>
<p>Images.</p>
<p>Exist.</p>
<p>Now maybe for smarter I could make it work with one but let's not.</p>
<p>Let's not sort of worry too much about that part of it.</p>
<p>The only thing that should matter is grab index should be greater than negative 1 because it's starting the index of the food is currently grabbed.</p>
<p>I think that's why they're too separate things.</p>
<p>Index.</p>
<p>Should be the same thing and it shouldn't be a need for two of them but one is one isn't really grabbed one is placed I think it's just I haven't worried that very well.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I think we use grub food more to indicate where the food was placed.</p>
<p>Which is different.</p>
<p>I could rename it.</p>
<p>Let me see that again.</p>
<p>Grab food goes from -1.</p>
<p>Who won yeah because that's even weird so that's a food type that's grabbed it's not even an indexer it's the index of the food type not the index of the cell change to 5 what the fuck.</p>
<p>Is this thing even working properly I mean it must be right because.</p>
<p>When I move the pizza slice to pizza slice moves what was grabbed.</p>
<p>Then grabbed food as soon as I move the.</p>
<p>Who goes back to negative one.</p>
<p>But I like such like.</p>
<p>I like solving problems right because I would do this if I didn't.</p>
<p>And I like to understand things and I like to build things and you know I don't know I guess it's.</p>
<p>And I don't like giving up on things.</p>
<p>So i'm kind of stubborn about trying to find out.</p>
<p>What is going wrong in and trying to fix it.</p>
<p>Even though.</p>
<p>The laziest worst version of something that you could have made rather than like the best version of something that you could have made I like to strike to try and make.</p>
<p>Sorry I think I just don't think my head's.</p>
<p>Any good place for this right now so i'll take a break.</p>
<p>I think the best thing to do with this is to rip it out and this is the other issue right it's been a while since I actually put the first part of this together because ok so what happened with this project is I wanted to make a match 3 game started making a match 3 game it was great.</p>
<p>And then I run it the issues with the food throwing thing and I just couldn't get it to work and I was just pissing me off.</p>
<p>Is it for a while came back to a retry a couple of times now.</p>
<p>I'm not as familiar with this project as I kind of should be given that I made it.</p>
<p>It was a while ago now.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's better to just kind of not start again cos i've got a lot of good stuff here it's not like let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater but i'm gonna go to the babies eyes out and give it some glass ones.</p>
<p>Wow that was fucking dark ok let's stop talking.</p>
<p>What I mean is.</p>
<p>I'm going to come back to this i'm going to take a little break for now.</p>
<p>Come back to this and i'm going to basically undo the whole ghost system.</p>
<p>Edit tangled and I kind of.</p>
<p>It's probably easier and quicker just to rip it out.</p>
<p>And then feed it back in again from the beginning.</p>
<p>And then i'll also have a better understanding of.</p>
<p>I love the it wasn't my code that was originally broken that kind of.</p>
<p>You know put me off this project in the first place.</p>
<p>Listen to unity and I have never seen bugs.</p>
<p>What's before and it looks like it works like it what way do you always get bugs in the bleeding edges version of the un.</p>
<p>Is the few that have encountered so far like they're like they're like so bad.</p>
<p>And then I found a bloody bug report with them recently.</p>
<p>Can.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Dark days for your head would a minute.</p>
<p>They got this new are.</p>
<p>When are the forcing people to use and it's.</p>
<p>It's giving shit results.</p>
<p>Can you do our highway they're not very.</p>
<p>Flexible.</p>
<p>Yeah so like when something if something bad happens in a real life.</p>
<p>Happy with the new rendering engine they will not let any.</p>
<p>When's this thing when does the.</p>
<p>When does all bouncy boobs go alive.</p>
<p>I don't want I want the other one but.</p>
<p>We can we'll do some sneaky polls.</p>
<p>What's up.</p>
<p>It's up.</p>
<p>Purchase which year was well.</p>
<p>What ice cream test for you on.</p>
<p>Who wants this.</p>
<p>Who the hell wants this.</p>
<p>Will build.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You would think that.</p>
<p>You would think that a voice recognition.</p>
<p>Ai.</p>
<p>Very very hard to make.</p>
<p>And a match 3 game would be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Is that true.</p>
<p>More so than you would expect anywhere put.</p>
<p>Stuff like that.</p>
<p>Make it requires a different type of thinking.</p>
<p>Where's most of his stuff is all like.</p>
<p>Api stuffing internet connection.</p>
<p>Thanks for that really.</p>
<p>But handling this like.</p>
<p>Unknown grid size and then having to go like horizontally and vertically and you just using numbers and all this other stuff it's like it can be.</p>
<p>What's my brown a bit.</p>
<p>Can be kind of awkward to settle east.</p>
<p>Ok so we can do tons of trials so when's my girl coming.</p>
<p>Cancel what time do you get off.</p>
<p>Let's do a trial.</p>
<p>I want to try my wife.</p>
<p>Am I like.</p>
<p>Am I being unfaithful already where is this actually a change you could chuck.</p>
<p>That's a good one though isn't it look at that.</p>
<p>Why is she got a tail the hell.</p>
<p>Make much better.</p>
<p>Add confident ice cream tits.</p>
<p>Is the fan service in this game is just.</p>
<p>Hello is there anybody.</p>
<p>What is a skill do.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Can you give me some enemies or something.</p>
<p>This trial sucks.</p>
<p>Play it's only for pervan on the model it's got no interest in actually.</p>
<p>Is this just a skin for ice cream tit.</p>
<p>Thinking about it.</p>
<p>No i'm curious.</p>
<p>I thought she was getting a new version.</p>
<p>Nice skin.</p>
<p>Skin is good not gonna lie.</p>
<p>She still doesn't roll.</p>
<p>Who does this shit dash.</p>
<p>I thought we're getting a new character.</p>
<p>That is a very nice skin but.</p>
<p>Ice cream to soil at this point.</p>
<p>Listening yeah you mean 5 days and 16 hours.</p>
<p>What is the new hall mats.</p>
<p>New character.</p>
<p>The hell is that good.</p>
<p>Take a little tie.</p>
<p>Automatic pistol.</p>
<p>How many are you pulling are you skipping.</p>
<p>I'll build pity on a banner or whatever.</p>
<p>I don't know like should i.</p>
<p>Should I get ice cream tits as weapon maybe.</p>
<p>Is mark thinking about it is my my weapons guaranteed now.</p>
<p>Is it bit of an extreme trial isn't it kill one more.</p>
<p>Set 12 of 13 before.</p>
<p>It still is it just keeps saying 12:13.</p>
<p>Does it want me to kill the boss is that why.</p>
<p>Yeah I think my weapons guaranteed now cos I feel who was I trying to get.</p>
<p>I was trying to get a new life weapon and I didn't get it today.</p>
<p>This trial last forever what the hell it's actually making me kill the boss isn't it.</p>
<p>Trials don't normally do that.</p>
<p>No good.</p>
<p>As usual the old does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Might as well flick it on the nose.</p>
<p>Die already.</p>
<p>Good god.</p>
<p>What is the longest trial in the history of trials.</p>
<p>Have they got new buttons to click.</p>
<p>What the fuck is the animation.</p>
<p>Commander doll in my cleavage.</p>
<p>As you do.</p>
<p>Yes she is.</p>
<p>Alright I suppose we should take care of energy first.</p>
<p>I forgot to spend the last of my previous events it was only a little bit.</p>
<p>Early trial operation midnight man story.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Yes at show.</p>
<p>Cancel the volume.</p>
<p>My eyes.</p>
<p>Yes we have a very diverse stream hear peter so.</p>
<p>I'm going to show respect to all accents.</p>
<p>Agents.</p>
<p>No favouritism.</p>
<p>Can you see where the budget went.</p>
<p>What's booth physics right.</p>
<p>256 we still have more energy than we.</p>
<p>How did that happen.</p>
<p>Is boost still showing up.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened to him the other the other day.</p>
<p>Ok now we're out of our carpet.</p>
<p>I feel the go up as in clothes and then he's going.</p>
<p>Nika has an evangelion collab on right now.</p>
<p>It's like a fool I went and got asked to go.</p>
<p>Videos.</p>
<p>This crap.</p>
<p>Genshin has an image to uphold you know.</p>
<p>We can't have time and running around in a knickers.</p>
<p>Not there is a what's the events darius having a club with fate granddaughter did you see that.</p>
<p>Yes darrell's having an event with fat granddaughter.</p>
<p>Because star islands.</p>
<p>I don't even know.</p>
<p>Is there very protective over the game tonight.</p>
<p>That's what I think.</p>
<p>Mia and evangelion they're always doing collabs.</p>
<p>I don't know how true this is either but zepler was playing genshin last night and she was talking about some of the updates.</p>
<p>And she said that the change to the.</p>
<p>Is that now it's 5545 so it's actually just an extra 5% chance of winning the 50/50.</p>
<p>Turn light every other weapon now.</p>
<p>I don't even think you will win the world level rises.</p>
<p>The person ask.</p>
<p>Alrighty where we are.</p>
<p>When's the last level yet.</p>
<p>How do you know if you've cleared out.</p>
<p>Oh there we go so we did.</p>
<p>All that we got 100 gems for something are there any redemption cards or anything.</p>
<p>Are the selling energy now for crystals.</p>
<p>The last time I saw redemption codes for this it was actually in notices.</p>
<p>Is it account.</p>
<p>Redeem.</p>
<p>Exchange successful.</p>
<p>Holy shit that was 400 what the hell.</p>
<p>Another 400 I just got 800 thank.</p>
<p>800 gems.</p>
<p>Two cards.</p>
<p>On standard banner on the weapon banner I got to 39 and it's guaranteed now.</p>
<p>I lost the last 50/50.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Ok google purple.</p>
<p>Precious baby.</p>
<p>Lots of red lots of yellow dots.</p>
<p>The thing didn't reset then.</p>
<p>How how are the sister standard one noise now.</p>
<p>That's enough and I guess.</p>
<p>Get lost to.</p>
<p>Get a revision.</p>
<p>Do those too fast.</p>
<p>44.</p>
<p>45.</p>
<p>Hi simon thank you for joining.</p>
<p>Come on come on come on we're almost at 50.</p>
<p>Quickly level up I don't know you.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Come on weapon come on come on I wanted this weapon for so long when the game first came out I failed this weapons 50/50 the first the one of the first pools I did in the game after I got her I went for the weapon.</p>
<p>It went gold and I was like.</p>
<p>Give me some I can show you what it gave me actually get me.</p>
<p>48 come on come on come on come on.</p>
<p>It's guaranteed as well.</p>
<p>It's guaranteed.</p>
<p>We're getting this we're getting this today.</p>
<p>Girl is the nurse is it.</p>
<p>Ok so let's see where what's the quickest way.</p>
<p>What's the quickest way for me to gas.</p>
<p>Neural.</p>
<p>Yeah it should be up.</p>

<p>Well I wasn't expecting that much of a difference.</p>
<p>She can actually do damage.</p>
<p>Yeah she's actually good now.</p>
<p>Peter win match.</p>
<p>Just the best.</p>
<p>Yeah that's that's an insane amount of difference.</p>
<p>I wasn't expecting to be that much.</p>
<p>That's quite possible.</p>
<p>This seems like ridiculously.</p>
<p>Stop freezing me.</p>
<p>Using her trying out her character trial before release and then they were like she's a bit shit.</p>
<p>I think that's possible you know.</p>
<p>Make sense unless her.</p>
<p>Yeah she's much better now.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>5 days and 15 hours that is.</p>
<p>How much less than a year.</p>
<p>5 days.</p>
<p>That's what I win my 5545.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised at genshin didn't just do what snow break did to be honest.</p>
<p>He's another banner.</p>
<p>The rats are shares.</p>
<p>What are the times you are going to want the guarantee.</p>
<p>Apply burning.</p>
<p>Apply burning to your skin.</p>
<p>Yeah it makes it hard for me to know how much this weapons doing.</p>
<p>120.</p>
<p>Can I get your ice cream out I shouldn't do it easy.</p>
<p>40%.</p>
<p>42%.</p>
<p>Shampoo.</p>
<p>She was the first character I built really so I think she just got whatever she got whatever she got.</p>
<p>I didn't even think about it I got attacked percent.</p>
<p>Alignment index shield construction efficiency she probably doesn't even have a shield.</p>
<p>What element is she.</p>
<p>Yellow what the hell is yellow.</p>
<p>Electrical.</p>
<p>I got six of these apparently.</p>
<p>Now I always see electrical.</p>
<p>Are you having a laugh.</p>
<p>Go away.</p>
<p>I get a 10.6 is better than 7.4 does she even have any auxiliary units what does it even mean auxiliary unit strength let's have a look at another one.</p>
<p>Healing bonus.</p>
<p>Yeah she sucks.</p>
<p>What is the do I have the recommended set on her.</p>
<p>Is that her recommended set.</p>
<p>What set is this.</p>
<p>Oh look.</p>
<p>How did english voice.</p>
<p>That wasn't there before.</p>
<p>Do you think we might be getting new english voices.</p>
<p>So my general should be set to english already I think.</p>
<p>How do I change.</p>
<p>What language.</p>
<p>What happened with one with some of my characters they added.</p>
<p>Put on.</p>
<p>Did since this part they definitely added english as an option now per character so on this per character.</p>
<p>Yeah but they definitely added it ok so even.</p>
<p>Some characters just don't have english.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that it doesn't show english for characters like act.</p>
<p>English voice now.</p>
<p>Yeah which is nice because i.</p>
<p>To be fair some of them are like mixed anywhere because obviously they didn't record new.</p>
<p>I still prefer english where I can get it.</p>
<p>It's funny.</p>
<p>Alright that's cool.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p>That will be that will be my thing on it so I need to do jaws on.</p>
<p>And then there's the new story.</p>
<p>George on in the new story and I think that's me up today I think.</p>
<p>Quick rest up.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm glad the poster.</p>
<p>Actually useless.</p>
<p>Quit damage.</p>
<p>When you can shoot like this.</p>
<p>Take it off.</p>
<p>So you done the new story i'm guessing.</p>
<p>Your ass.</p>
<p>You froze me a bastards.</p>
<p>Shocked me.</p>
<p>I'm not used to.</p>
<p>Taking damage.</p>
<p>Electrical damage that's me.</p>
<p>Health.</p>
<p>Juicy juicy health.</p>
<p>26%.</p>
<p>Little bit strong.</p>
<p>Let's take life haven't used it for a while.</p>
<p>I wish i.</p>
<p>Can you buy their weapons.</p>
<p>If you don't already own them probably not right.</p>
<p>Cos I do have enough trash weapons right now to buy one.</p>
<p>But I think you have to already on it.</p>
<p>I'll have to check.</p>
<p>I think you have to already on it.</p>
<p>Shouldn't she be english.</p>
<p>Post english boy car.</p>
<p>A ballistic damage up.</p>
<p>Still in centimetres.</p>
<p>The nurse character doesn't heal.</p>

<p>Yeah man there's 25 nurses over there.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>I don't even know what damaged me so much I just.</p>
<p>Very early on.</p>
<p>I took a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Do we both get to pick them up.</p>
<p>I'm stuck how I got i'm stuck I can't move.</p>
<p>Stuck on you.</p>

<p>There we go that's what I need.</p>
<p>Has sprint everywhere and he'll.</p>
<p>I'll be unstoppable.</p>
<p>Like I like her kids it's just that mine's kind of trash and she doesn't do as much time.</p>
<p>Add and I think that's like.</p>
<p>58% i'm surprised actually because I felt like I played like shit.</p>
<p>How many murderers to do.</p>
<p>Jeez I need a thousand.</p>
<p>Have I got 3 days left as well so it might be a good idea to get this done.</p>
<p>So I should probably do.</p>
<p>Does units that you get buffs for in there isn't there like extra points.</p>
<p>Ok so fight.</p>
<p>Giggling area control.</p>
<p>Yes I can take tragic mad I guess.</p>
<p>I can take tragic mad I get my points right.</p>
<p>I don't mind tragic made too much just a freaking voice than a nice me like kit while she's actually pretty good.</p>
<p>Just annoying.</p>
<p>Is this a mixture.</p>

<p>Much much better much more cheerful.</p>
<p>For me.</p>
<p>No we're going to give them a cup of tea what do you think.</p>
<p>Why you probably giving your booty.</p>
<p>Tragic pregnancy.</p>
<p>She was made to get pregnant.</p>
<p>The craziest part is every word I say now gets uploaded to my website.</p>
<p>Tell us why.</p>
<p>We'll see cos I want to implement a search engine in my website but I need text to search.</p>
<p>Pc boo already detects everything I say during the stream so why don't I just.</p>
<p>If I ever do useful streams it could be useful because if i'm covering a topic.</p>
<p>People could in the research for that topic even if the stream wasn't about that topic and then find which stream it came from.</p>
<p>But yeah since implementing the system i've done a sing songs about pregnant man.</p>
<p>Do wonder what kind of google searches.</p>
<p>Are they supposed to be invisible are you.</p>
<p>I see you.</p>
<p>Not so sneaky.</p>
<p>Are they supposed to be invisible they don't normally do this today.</p>
<p>It's like he's normal state that's supposed to be visible is showing that instead.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>He's there.</p>
<p>Are you that you're good.</p>
<p>Monster.</p>
<p>What is.</p>
<p>Yeah that was.</p>
<p>That was some shenanigans.</p>
<p>Ok how much is.</p>
<p>Silly cows outfit.</p>
<p>It was only like 10 things but I want to know what it was.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Where the hell was I looking.</p>
<p>See these are all the outfits sunday so if I got a quartermaster.</p>
<p>How about seeing things.</p>
<p>Yeah 98 that's like.</p>
<p>It is nice but I don't know it's not.</p>
<p>I think about over time to think about it.</p>
<p>What did I see when I first logged in and I swore that was selling something for 10.</p>
<p>Think by those energy cubes.</p>
<p>I am plymouth dog boys.</p>
<p>I'm finally almost got my.</p>
<p>Beyond skipping.</p>
<p>Sounds like you're having fun.</p>
<p>Plume the selecter set.</p>
<p>So what is this what's all this about.</p>
<p>Combo gift packs.</p>
<p>Os I pick I can pick between tights or no tights red horns and black horns.</p>
<p>That's great funny actually.</p>
<p>I don't actually.</p>
<p>I can't even decide.</p>
<p>Do you like a boss do you not get like so you have to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>Outfit parts this is what I this is what I was looking at outfit parts yeah this is dodgy as fuck so now they sell you the outfit and you got to buy these extra parts so if you wanted both options you have to pay an extra 20.</p>
<p>Snowbridge something needed with wedding girls last patch.</p>
<p>Yeah I got I got sad because I failed the 50/50 on the webinar.</p>
<p>No I wanted to get.</p>
<p>So let's start with red horns and no tights.</p>
<p>Then I would go and pay attention and get the black horns and the tights I guess.</p>
<p>Which isn't too bad I don't know what's 10.</p>
<p>It's not too bad.</p>
<p>What's the battle pass skin.</p>
<p>That one.</p>
<p>Ask you get a you get a weapon for the battle pass.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah cos I saw the weapon but I didn't think.</p>
<p>I didn't even it didn't even click that it was the battle pass thing so now they're starting to do weapons on the bus that's interesting.</p>
<p>Ok so that's it that's interesting that they're doing a weapon.</p>
<p>An outfit this time.</p>
<p>Also you can choose one or the other.</p>
<p>How do you get balls.</p>
<p>Let's see include all rewards in advance pass.</p>
<p>Stella pass for limited time do you get balls or do you have to pick.</p>
<p>I maybe not.</p>
<p>Are weapons skin I tell you a weapon skin.</p>
<p>And you probably need the.</p>
<p>Signature weapon for a diet.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't actually.</p>
<p>First time.</p>

<p>This isn't the best most the most amazingly telegraphed.</p>
<p>Game level i've ever played.</p>
<p>Is there a man of a genshin player I like things to be spelled out with me.</p>
<p>Go through the laser filled hallway yeah i'm trying.</p>
<p>Ok this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>And I go back and see if there's another panel.</p>
<p>You know I didn't say another panel.</p>
<p>We'll figure it out.</p>
<p>Figure it out.</p>

<p>Suddenly went very quiet in stream.</p>
<p>Do people leave to avoid spoilers or something.</p>
<p>Is there a red thing that I need to get because they seem invincible to me.</p>
<p>Can't see one.</p>
<p>Are you playing this as well.</p>
<p>I can't wait I thought I killed all the red things are you still going to get behind the shields ok.</p>
<p>So even when.</p>
<p>You get rid of the security devices you have to sneak up the item.</p>
<p>Look locally they have the intelligence of a wet fish.</p>
<p>Slightly smarter than a dry fish.</p>
<p>Barney slightly.</p>
<p>You have 500 energy.</p>
<p>So what are you.</p>
<p>For future character.</p>
<p>Supremacy.</p>
<p>New event.</p>
<p>New events new event.</p>
<p>Ok we actually get ice cream tips this time.</p>
<p>As the trial character interesting.</p>
<p>So we'll bring actual alarm that's all you really need.</p>
<p>Screen capture.</p>
<p>So did you do the story already.</p>
<p>Are you serving it.</p>
<p>Ok we can't shoot the red things.</p>
<p>Is it is funny though cuz.</p>
<p>I think county is a little bit like picker in the fact that.</p>
<p>Game on playing.</p>
<p>Is that replay the same games but not at the same time.</p>
<p>Metal gear petrol.</p>
<p>Typical gacha game now has nothing to do for like weeks.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>So much to do.</p>
<p>Next to stg.</p>
<p>Be the saviour of happiness.</p>
<p>That is what people call me.</p>
<p>And we got.</p>
<p>Some crap.</p>
<p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>We redeemed song.</p>
<p>We may run out.</p>
<p>Before the event ends.</p>
<p>Triangle.</p>
<p>Disable all bombs.</p>
<p>Sing.</p>
<p>Disable bombs.</p>
<p>Stupid so I guess i've got a shoot that.</p>
<p>And then interact with that there we go.</p>
<p>I figured it out.</p>
<p>Charge around it.</p>
<p>On the run down here.</p>
<p>Spyder gloves.</p>
<p>Do you see me on youtube.</p>
<p>Please pause the second give a test.</p>
<p>Should be.</p>
<p>Is she not reading youtube.</p>
<p>Let me read youtube.</p>
<p>Before we do.</p>
<p>So we got when I know that game I play that game before I think a few years ago this one is called snow brake but it's been out just over a year now isn't it so you might be.</p>
<p>Set up with a similar game.</p>
<p>Third person shooter.</p>
<p>Yeah so if it was more than a year ago I must have been a different game.</p>
<p>Let me restart my assistant.</p>
<p>Play with me.</p>
<p>Cast to another one.</p>
<p>Always something.</p>
<p>Actually the one yeah I think the one that actually the one I had to reset recently was a.</p>
<p>Youtube so it makes sense that youtube probably needs refreshing.</p>
<p>We just read it.</p>
<p>Authentication.</p>
<p>Yeah I can see you but I can't hear you because tts is needs fixing.</p>
<p>I can see you on twitch better.</p>
<p>Yes i've got i've got it set up so that my chat messages read out to me because.</p>
<p>Have a very small screen.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>So this is what my screen looks like but I have a very small second screen so it's very small text as you can see and I just can't really read it from where I am so that's why I have it read it out to me but it seems that that's not what.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>Started working I need to look at that it seems a bit glitchy door.</p>
<p>Inspect the final bomb completed give me another objective markers I thought i'd take it over there.</p>
<p>Yeah did you did you want to ask or say something.</p>
<p>Alright so.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>Set catcher.</p>
<p>Is really bad I got a bad pain.</p>
<p>Yeah I want your fat one of the reasons why your messages.</p>
<p>Try and fix that.</p>
<p>So I don't think it's just you I think it's i've got the issues my end as well.</p>
<p>No cancel that alarm.</p>
<p>I can't over there.</p>
<p>39.</p>
<p>I can't go over there so I got to kill him from here.</p>
<p>Yeah that's what i'm doing i'm just trying to make sure that everything is.</p>
<p>Is a super super awkward.</p>
<p>She's a five-star ig.</p>
<p>5 star in game is that.</p>
<p>Who'd you get.</p>
<p>Who would you get.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>Yes I like the fact that I can just skip it I don't understand why they just dissolve as soon as I stand on them that seems really badly telegraphed as well maybe only one side would still open it was about figuring out which side did what but that isn't particularly fun.</p>
<p>Yes who's the new five star.</p>
<p>How to get hedgehog because that's all makes everything easier.</p>
<p>I'm guessing.</p>
<p>Yes she was my first five star actually.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Ok so now we're on this stage.</p>
<p>We don't have enough energy so i'm going to need to do a refresh.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Can we clear it with the energy we've got.</p>
<p>I don't know we've got 12.</p>
<p>How many cost 12.</p>
<p>Random outfit are you can shuffle outfits now that's great cool.</p>
<p>How did a random outfit button.</p>
<p>Yeah you know I had breakfast today which I don't always do.</p>

<p>Too much to do too much to do.</p>
<p>Chapter 7.</p>
<p>All right let's do it.</p>
<p>Where we going to be doing any food.</p>
<p>Call team.</p>
<p>Is is stock.</p>
<p>Dinner so that's like evening mail.</p>
<p>Yeah cos we're weird in the uk so will some people said dinner as lunch.</p>
<p>I'll lunch dinner.</p>
<p>And a dinner what america and the rest of the world seems to call dinner is like what we call t.</p>
<p>Very strange in the uk.</p>
<p>Play radio 1.</p>
<p>Ok so the things invincible right now which is what the yellow.</p>
<p>The yellow bar round it means.</p>
<p>And now i'm really hungry which is.</p>
<p>This morning.</p>
<p>Alright mission complete.</p>
<p>That is ridiculous that I saw ridiculous.</p>
<p>Fun service what fun services are you talking about.</p>
<p>Very serious shooting game.</p>
<p>It's like a it's probably what they use in in the armies to turn the soldiers you know.</p>
<p>How to react in times of war.</p>
<p>Reward.</p>
<p>Three gold.</p>
<p>So I probably shouldn't be doing this but the odds of getting her is like 0.1% so the way I see it if she shows up at 0.1% it was meant to be.</p>
<p>But it won't happen so it's fine.</p>
<p>So I play nino cooney which I really liked.</p>
<p>I played them all.</p>
<p>It looked great.</p>
<p>When did the same thing with life is strange which was another game.</p>
<p>Your face the story already.</p>
<p>What's the last what's the last level.</p>
<p>Look at this.</p>
<p>Fancy.</p>
<p>I will take your life and with it your sins.</p>
<p>While bringing an end to this long nights.</p>
<p>Oh my god we've got to kill lady gaga.</p>
<p>Zombie gaga.</p>
<p>If finally happens.</p>
<p>Is finally happening.</p>
<p>I'd like to book i'd like to book a lady gaga which is all tied up right now.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I like the effects that's pretty cool.</p>
<p>Nightborne what phantasm.</p>
<p>Ok we could be heading towards the neon genesis remember that girl who looks like neon looks like neptune or I want.</p>
<p>I feel like we're getting.</p>
<p>I live in hope that I can get my very own little nap nap.</p>
<p>That'll be good.</p>
<p>Ok does a boss guide something about a duke of corruption I can't read all that right now you kidding me.</p>
<p>I have no idea what that says.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Start reading.</p>
<p>Pause what parts.</p>
<p>Is that the dude the dog boy absolutely not if that's the case I don't know the names.</p>
<p>If it's the ones up now the dog boy yeah no I don't I don't pull the guys typically I only pull the way foods.</p>
<p>Prefer the female characters.</p>
<p>30% but it gives me time to save.</p>
<p>And stop streaming what and everything.</p>
<p>I didn't watch the latest live stream cuz they were talking about it on the stream I watch last night.</p>
<p>I do remember her yeah yeah no I think yeah the general yeah we met her in the story didn't we.</p>
<p>Yeah I think she's kind of boring personally.</p>
<p>I'm not really that interested.</p>
<p>So i'll probably skip I mean.</p>
<p>Could you pause while she's up and if I get a regular if I don't I don't but yeah not really planning on getting her.</p>
<p>I love the new mart store the new march is fant.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>Play some timer save martin restore my resources.</p>
<p>Did I do it all file too.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>Let's talk.</p>
<p>Is he not good.</p>
<p>300 requested to see me outside the company my meetings with theatre or whatever that is i'm going to call the theatre we're almost invariably in her office she rarely ventured out and she almost never indulged in alcohol.</p>
<p>Risks like assassination attempts on bugging.</p>
<p>Is she here on a.</p>
<p>If you are the first rays of dawn have a glorious summer then I shall be the last flower to bloom in late spring time flows relentlessly on.</p>
<p>Add sandwich to pause this moment.</p>
<p>Even parallel something.</p>
<p>When you miss me just look up to the sky and smile my dearest love my dear is treasure hold on.</p>
<p>As I read on the letter was a broccoli snatched from 100 million blushing video before me.</p>
<p>What's new it's new girl.</p>
<p>Will you put some clothes on your skank oh my gosh she's such a.</p>
<p>What are floozy.</p>
<p>2424.</p>
<p>24/50.</p>
<p>I'm 5545 on shark go vacation.</p>
<p>Apparently that's what the.</p>
<p>Just an extra 5%.</p>
<p>It's down to 5545.</p>
<p>Shark girl will she.</p>
<p>How long do I have for that cos I am tiring of this game right now.</p>
<p>9 days to do children.</p>
<p>I need to neural simulation tomorrow though.</p>
<p>Has any three days left on that one.</p>
<p>Ok google one more.</p>
<p>Call for spyder gloves I don't think we'll get her I don't want to.</p>
<p>What are these days that's going to happen even at a 0.1% chance cos it's like a one in a thousand.</p>
<p>On average.</p>
<p>What is this what do you want.</p>
<p>Change outfits.</p>
<p>They never give me a new santa claus I don't even get a wedding ring i'm married now and I don't even get a ring will you forever wear this ring for me pretty please no.</p>
<p>Will you forever wear this ring as a symbol of our eternal love I can't believe the game gives you two wives so weird.</p>
<p>Just keeps saying will I forever do you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Snowy yes hello how are you.</p>
<p>Do you have to buy the ring without real money.</p>
<p>Are we unlock unlock after obtaining life infinite sites outfit yes basically that is ridiculous.</p>
<p>That is ridiculous you have to spend money.</p>
<p>To get the ring.</p>
<p>Epic online services does it not uninstall with epic game launcher.</p>
<p>The thing is with epic online services as well though is for example I play fault.</p>
<p>This is my new one.</p>
<p>Timer.</p>
<p>Updated.</p>
<p>Revenue revenue ai i'm always changing this thing i'm always messing with it.</p>
<p>Yeah this one actually changes with the game that I play but.</p>
<p>It's gone.</p>
<p>I can't remember.</p>
<p>Yeah i'll do it here I think for the day we'll spend our energy.</p>
<p>Cos I might hit 99.</p>
<p>What I was saying right so the thing is.</p>
<p>Epic game launcher and online services.</p>
<p>Requires epic online services but I don't have to have the launcher installed so they are two separate things.</p>
<p>So if you play anything on steam that requires sad service.</p>
<p>In google type iobit uninstall.</p>
<p>Free software.</p>
<p>Download this this thing's grace it lets you uninstall.</p>
<p>Pretty much anything.</p>
<p>Windows built-in features anything that you can't install through the normal windows thing.</p>
<p>However these guys have gotten very much like advertising this is this software used to be great I used to have it on all the time but now they're like pop-up ads on your system and stuff the bastards.</p>
<p>I only download this as and when I you know want to get rid of some awkward thing.</p>
<p>Come off any other way.</p>
<p>I didn't start it.</p>
<p>Yeah I am going to play some day but i've just been busy.</p>
<p>I want a time.</p>
<p>Before then.</p>
<p>Christmas.</p>
<p>Tutorials at the moment.</p>
<p>The reason I put that one on hold is because I kind of got mad at all the stream as I was making the game in.</p>
<p>Again so I need to go and change all the characters but that's going to be a whole hoopla because it means i'm gonna have to look at ways to make consistent characters in ai.</p>
<p>Yeah I would just it won't take up a lot of storage but like I said I hope it uninstaller.</p>
<p>Installer and then it should show up.</p>
<p>You're not sure but normal windows.</p>
<p>I guess it doesn't show up as an installed app it's probably a service.</p>
<p>Make me a service.</p>
<p>So yeah try I hope it uninstall if it doesn't show up in there then you only other option is to manually rip it out and that can be tricky and can cause more trouble than it's worth so you might want to reconsider.</p>
<p>How is dua windows.</p>
<p>Are windows restore point before you start messing with stuff like that so at least you can always roll back if you.</p>
<p>Take take the wrong thing out.</p>
<p>Right so let me see I need to farm my energy.</p>
<p>Spell management.</p>
<p>5 gold this is gonna be enough right.</p>
<p>5 gold 9.</p>
<p>And two.</p>
<p>It wasn't quite enough we still haven't hit level 99.</p>
<p>And we have.</p>
<p>Only one of those.</p>
<p>So I can get some of these though.</p>
<p>Positive.</p>
<p>Yeah I was working on my thing you speaking about games I was working on my mini game thing but.</p>
<p>He said like.</p>
<p>That was abrupt.</p>
<p>How was that.</p>
<p>Say in a way it's nice that they actually have like some.</p>
<p>Depth to the events it's just that that depth is like.</p>
<p>Click this button 6000 times.</p>
<p>So we can time get your rewards.</p>
<p>And it's like wow.</p>
<p>This is so on appealing.</p>
<p>Countdown particularly hate for either of those things.</p>
<p>I think she might be a four-star so if I can pick them both up.</p>
<p>Does a show keeper and then there's like a little version of a shark keep or something.</p>
<p>Although she sounds a bit like she might be a bit like fouche one like fists and stuff overnight yeah but it would be funny to have a full team of lollies right because we're like 2/3 they're already so if we can put another chibi on it that would be quite funny and.</p>
<p>We have a lolly team which would be funny.</p>
<p>But she's a five star then obviously it doesn't know where I can.</p>
<p>Get to 5 stars.</p>
<p>But I saw a youtube thumbnail last night.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>They reset the nodes on here as well.</p>
<p>How long has it got left on it 36 days.</p>
<p>I would probably just wait until the year 31 days that's fine i'll just wait for the barn at the end rather than do it now because otherwise what I end up doing is i'll end up doing more poles on her banner.</p>
<p>Whisky now.</p>
<p>Dislike where are we 510 15 20 25 30 so do I really want to lose 30 pity.</p>
<p>Towards shark eva.</p>
<p>Banner changes which is another two weeks.</p>
<p>Kilograms don't really care.</p>
<p>We have full energy that's bleeding into the overflow.</p>
<p>Off alarm.</p>
<p>And what do I need.</p>
<p>I need a quiet.</p>
<p>We need some of these twirlees for arena so I guess i'll just get these it's.</p>
<p>It's going to read that out now.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Stop reading.</p>
<p>Walking with graveyard.</p>
<p>Of death.</p>
<p>And emptiness do you know what I mean it's like.</p>
<p>I really do struggle to see what other people saying this.</p>
<p>I like the.</p>
<p>One resounding thing that everybody says has it has gone for it is it's combat.</p>
<p>It's all right and that's about it.</p>
<p>In the year 2525.</p>
<p>10 minutes.</p>
<p>If I go into reader.</p>
<p>If I got a reader.</p>
<p>What is it you like about it is it just to come by.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>Yeah I want to like this game I just I just don't.</p>
<p>That's not too bad i've seen worse.</p>
<p>I've seen worse.</p>
<p>Call peter welcome back.</p>
<p>You showing up when i'm playing with them where is that's very unlike you.</p>
<p>Thanks for help.</p>
<p>Kiss for me I think I think the most.</p>
<p>The thing I like the most about it would have been the you know the new areas and exploring them when they were still new areas which is kind of how I like to tara fantasy.</p>
<p>I find particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Genuinely interested.</p>
<p>Why do you think i'm not going to be playing with them where is it all we have this conversation already that's why you don't listen.</p>
<p>Just because genshin's getting a patch doesn't mean i'm not going to log in and do my 10 minutes of wuthering website please.</p>
<p>So i'm not going to be stopping I don't.</p>
<p>It's like you think you.</p>
<p>Are you getting better internet I love you phone.</p>
<p>That would be it.</p>
<p>I still got I can do the daily quest actually let's do this early quest and then we'll level up farina.</p>
<p>And then that's it we're done.</p>
<p>Taste like 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah they reset that game mode with the door but it's got a month on it.</p>
<p>And so i'll just wait until the final changes over I think to do that.</p>
<p>I won't be tempted to spend the.</p>
<p>The reward currency on.</p>
<p>I've got a tonne of echoes to like.</p>
<p>Role as well.</p>
<p>So we go to marina.</p>
<p>I should I probably need to do some synthesis.</p>

<p>Returning and having a lot of stuff to do.</p>
<p>Cast this time I didn't actually.</p>
<p>Will both this time and font.</p>
<p>I didn't actually leave.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Which has its ups and downs.</p>
<p>It's raining city anywhere.</p>
<p>Play open world on friendly.</p>
<p>It almost makes me think that this was originally the prison.</p>
<p>And then they decided to make the prison on the water the last minute.</p>
<p>And it feels more like a prison than the sea.</p>
<p>Strength is the open world exploration element.</p>
<p>So hopefully this isn't a trend.</p>
<p>Answer to you.</p>
<p>Depends how much you want to re-experience at all again.</p>
<p>That's a lot.</p>
<p>And I mean from what you told me you know you need to sort of.</p>
<p>Dial back how often you play so that it doesn't affect your health.</p>
<p>Otherwise you might make yourself ill trying to catch up.</p>
<p>Alright so that is the for commissions.</p>
<p>Cosy catherine.</p>
<p>Thanks for notting catherine.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>Actually press the button.</p>
<p>Ok so now all i've got to do is.</p>
<p>The resin which I will.</p>
<p>Condensed in preparation for not.</p>
<p>I know that they're adding the marrakesh set.</p>
<p>When's the next patches.</p>
<p>Strong boxes.</p>
<p>So I feel better.</p>
<p>Getting my pieces that way because it's just i've spent so much resin at this point trying to get the thing to drop.</p>
<p>Either way I want to condense it though.</p>
<p>And this should be the battle pass.</p>
<p>683 mars 1 standard pool.</p>
<p>Yeah not looking that good.</p>
<p>What about 30 poles with 20 pity in.</p>
<p>I know we're getting 20 paul's for the anniversary i'm getting 5 for the strimmer event.</p>
<p>Exactly when some of these things are happening.</p>
<p>Are we getting the 20 poles on day one probably not.</p>
<p>Go on a farm navy's thing.</p>
<p>I don't have much hope there.</p>
<p>Try closing that browser I guess.</p>
<p>Every time.</p>
<p>The one thing I do hear about the ohio games is the.</p>
<p>Play gear levelling.</p>
<p>The gear farming.</p>
<p>Yeah I know.</p>
<p>Elemental mastery and defence see it's just auto trash every single time.</p>
<p>Put at the end of the day you know what these are actually these can be used in the strong box when we reroll.</p>
<p>System.</p>
<p>Xbox.</p>
<p>Do I have set this currently no plans to release on.</p>
<p>Airline is owned by sony essentially because guerrilla games is a.</p>
<p>All of their ip is essentially parent on by sony.</p>
<p>Call sony think about it.</p>
<p>Play the permission to do a collaboration with one of their big.</p>
<p>It gave them permission to use one of the you know platform selling characters from a platform selling franchise in their game and they also released it on sony and they had wings.</p>
<p>Playstation exclusive remember the laws.</p>
<p>So you got wings that were playstation closer so click clearly what's happened there is sony have done a deal with my hire.</p>
<p>Exclusivity.</p>
<p>So probably the reason it never came out on xbox.</p>
<p>That deals probably expired.</p>
<p>And now that's up.</p>
<p>Would be my guess.</p>
<p>The only reason it's not on switches because the switch hardware can't handle the game I mean i'm dropping friends here on pc so i'm not surprised to switch can't handle it.</p>
<p>But that that contract might have also extended to switch as well.</p>
<p>Originally.</p>
<p>Wow just absolute.</p>
<p>Just absolute trash drops every single one.</p>
<p>Why the fuck did it leave leave.</p>
<p>Yeah I mean that's exactly what I expected to happen trash trash trash trash trash trash waste of time waste of energy.</p>
<p>What's all evidence.</p>
<p>But I guess we can use more fodder for the strong box when the strong box comes out and maybe we can get something on.</p>
<p>I mean she's not terrible right now.</p>
<p>What's this.</p>
<p>How many showers got something to say to me.</p>
<p>Can you show us.</p>
<p>Randomly.</p>
<p>I'll get this just because it's friendship xp.</p>
<p>4 seater.</p>
<p>Level 10.</p>
<p>We bought the thing we did in by these though by these.</p>
<p>Why isn't it let me because it's hard to.</p>
<p>619 coins left.</p>
<p>Teapot large increasing as well in the next patch.</p>
<p>And that is genshin.</p>
<p>Going now.</p>
<p>I don't know how to get some food.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I disappeared now.</p>
<p>Ok that's weird he's disappeared now.</p>
<p>How long was the.</p>
<p>How long was the I missing for.</p>
<p>I'm asking you when it disappeared.</p>
<p>Was it gone by then.</p>
<p>I never see this happen.</p>
<p>It's working there.</p>
<p>It's working the disappear as watering worms comes up.</p>
<p>Did you not notice when it disappeared.</p>
<p>Yeah I need to know so I can fix that.</p>
<p>So it's worth fine for like 4 hours and 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Well I restarted him once or twice because of issues but they were different issues and I still there and now this was when I did the voice command so he disappeared since the next restart because he was restarted quite recently cos I did.</p>
<p>What do you need help with.</p>
<p>Ok I accidentally caused him to read that that's why.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Stop reading.</p>
<p>This is weird.</p>
<p>So it seems like like it would make sense if he disappeared.</p>
<p>If you disappeared when the reading mod was accidentally activated.</p>
<p>That was somewhat makes sense if it's not resetting itself after that properly.</p>
<p>But I restart him after that i'm pretty sure I did.</p>
<p>Keep getting cannot play a disabled audio device.</p>
<p>I think it died at some point during water and waves.</p>
<p>What is going on there.</p>
<p>Jesus adapted again by cannot display disabled audio songs.</p>
<p>Youtube api request successful can I play a disabled audio device.</p>
<p>So we do a youtube call on.</p>
<p>Updating stream then we do it again then we do it again.</p>
<p>Then we do it again.</p>
<p>Then we do it again and it shouldn't it shouldn't do it this many times.</p>
<p>So we changed to wuthering waves.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Can you put it on debug mode but after.</p>
<p>Try and find the.</p>
<p>Size it needs to be.</p>
<p>So only did the api request ones.</p>
<p>Yeah no it's not it's this isn't.</p>
<p>It's not a normal case error it's not like.</p>
<p>It'll work for like 6 hours right and then it breaks so it's not like this is it's not like your text messages i'm gonna go through.</p>
<p>This is something more like when I change games.</p>
<p>Multiple times a stream or something like that maybe.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>No I appreciate the help i'm just trying to.</p>
<p>Not get confused myself.</p>
<p>Should we have two coroutine managers.</p>
<p>Should we have actually we've got three coroutine managers right now.</p>
<p>We shouldn't have multiple quarantine managers.</p>
<p>That's kinda concerning.</p>
<p>Right so we can see.</p>
<p>We can see list of coroutines.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell because the amount of shit that gets thrown at it.</p>
<p>Sourz is kind of insane.</p>
<p>So I can't just throw 6 hours of stream on it and you know 3 minutes to make it trip up again.</p>
<p>It's difficult to know the exact.</p>
<p>Situation that it's getting itself.</p>
<p>In order to cause the issue.</p>
<p>The first place.</p>
<p>But all I can really go off is the player log and the player log.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Play cuz now it's impossible for multiple.</p>
<p>Coroutines to get tangled if.</p>
<p>It could even just be.</p>
<p>It could be as simple as the fact that somebody was sending a message because it seems to happen very.</p>
<p>Infrequently on the difficult to difficult to recreate conditions so an example is like let's say you typed something in chat for him to read.</p>
<p>The same time that something happens that causes him to.</p>
<p>Despite my best efforts.</p>
<p>I mean that shouldn't really happen because I programmed it for that not to happen so the way he works to avoid that from happening is his speech engine has like an inbox.</p>
<p>Which is this one here speak lines.</p>
<p>So if.</p>
<p>It's a chat message to read.</p>
<p>I send from one of my other systems a notification to say hey it looks like you're now playing this game or whatever the hell it is.</p>
<p>Just it was just add it to the inbox and then this system automatically processes what's in the inbox one after the other that was the whole point of the car routine manager.</p>
<p>Where it just did it again now.</p>
<p>Ok that shouldn't be happening.</p>
<p>Ok so it's doing.</p>
<p>Get channel info.</p>
<p>9159.</p>
<p>If it's coming through that pipe.</p>
<p>On art and it's going through that full.</p>
<p>System it also is doing this from the very first game.</p>
<p>So the first time we do the call we come in at the start of the runtime and we make sure all the tags and everything is updated.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>I think we need to work 2 minutes and see what happens.</p>
<p>I don't think it's coming through the pipe.</p>
<p>From.</p>
<p>Streaming for so it's not coming through the ai pipe.</p>
<p>Can you twitch was called.</p>
<p>And switch on youtube fbi's were called to update.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>In 2 minutes time.</p>
<p>I've also got updates stream the.</p>
<p>Yeah it's because I had to do all these sly things with tags.</p>
<p>So basically had to.</p>
<p>Change.</p>
<p>I add the ai assistant tag to let auto add to know whether the first added been run within the first hour on it.</p>
<p>This is what's broken at.</p>
<p>And so in order to get that working it seems like now it's just constantly updating it on every 2-minute call which yeah like you said it's probably.</p>
<p>Tell me the reason why youtube chats being dodgy.</p>
<p>So I might just be that i've.</p>
<p>Is my car.</p>
<p>Okay weird.</p>
<p>Ok we did get it we did get a rogue youtube api request successful.</p>
<p>Needs to be updated which I assume we are.</p>
<p>We should be good.</p>
<p>At the moment I have no idea I have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Well let's see the last the.</p>
<p>Can you twitch info was updated on 4226 so 42426.</p>
<p>4:25.</p>
<p>We know we're good.</p>
<p>Completely unrelated to pc boo disappearing door I would think I can't really think why.</p>
<p>What would cause pc boot disappear.</p>
<p>That's probably why youtube chat was broken.</p>
<p>Write youtube api request successful I want to keep my eye on that as well i'm not sure what that is.</p>
<p>Youtube's chat connection for 2 minutes as well because.</p>
<p>Can you twitch calls.</p>
<p>No it's still doing it.</p>
<p>The tax probably don't match our previous feels because our previous fields weren't set up to exclude.</p>
<p>Tag that was marking whether ads were running the first hour or not.</p>
<p>Yes it's kind of makes sense why this is happening.</p>
<p>The kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>Are any second now.</p>
<p>Constantly updating stream every 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Nutrition have been doing.</p>
<p>Most probably what killed youtube channel.</p>
<p>So how do we know when it's.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Well it's 4:36 right now.</p>
<p>If it gets.</p>
<p>To 4:38.</p>
<p>And doesn't do it.</p>
<p>Let me know we're good but it's still one more thing to test.</p>
<p>39.</p>
<p>39 so if we make it to 40.</p>
<p>And it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Then we know we fixed the bug however.</p>
<p>We don't get to celebrate just yet.</p>
<p>Number one because I never celebrate.</p>
<p>Number two.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>We need to test it.</p>
<p>Make sure it's still works when it needs to because sometimes you can over correct right so you know if you stop it from updating if something's updating too many times but it is supposed to update in certain circumstances and you fix it updating we're not 40 years.</p>
<p>Fix it from updating constantly they go we just hit 4:40 and it didn't happen.</p>
<p>So what are we doing now now we change to zen.</p>
<p>Then we know it's completely fixed because it's still doing it when it's supposed to do it.</p>
<p>What's no longer doing it on every single.</p>
<p>1 minute check.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>There we go set new twitch calls youtube updated twitch updated.</p>
<p>What is amazon 0 and if we refresh the stream.</p>
<p>Mastering the chaos comfy anime goucher creative assistant.</p>
<p>Put this is a different place in the chord ok i'll let me explain what just happened so what just happened is we didn't include the default tags when we made the initial changing game.</p>
<p>Ok so let me explain what's happening.</p>
<p>So when pc boo detects the game change we run the code from somewhere else to completely different script and we do the update yeah it's just fixed it now though what it should have done but where we were seeing the error was doing it where it was just checking it.</p>
<p>However it would be better because we were missing english and chatbot it would be better if it did it correctly the first time less api calls you know.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Ok so we need to make sure that the update in for.</p>
<p>Wait this is really weird.</p>
<p>If current tags.</p>
<p>Contains ai assistant the new tags equals new tags plus ai assistants.</p>
<p>Assistance to it that way.</p>
<p>New tags.</p>
<p>Well that's kind of weird cuz new tags doesn't include ai assistants.</p>
<p>Yeah ok so what's happening now.</p>
<p>So where do we add the tags.</p>
<p>Because it obviously needs to follow the same structure that the check is checking against because if it doesn't it's got a constantly think that it's wrong so it's going to basically try to fix it to what it should be but then the check is going to say well that's not what it should be.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I know the reason why as well because when we do the initial stream start and we pull the tags from twitch we basically copy the current tags we just remove the ai assistant part.</p>
<p>Put it in new tags.</p>
<p>But then when we change games.</p>
<p>We basically lose the default tags and then we're just pulling the tags from the game.</p>
<p>I'd like to get them work going to be honest and I think I just thought it would be.</p>
<p>I thought the worst case scenario would be that we just didn't have.</p>
<p>Tags wouldn't be exactly what they were meant to be and I was like i'll be fine.</p>
<p>Knock on effects.</p>
<p>Impact.</p>
<p>Cos we know it's working from it's initial.</p>
<p>Situation where was feelings when the game changers.</p>
<p>Yes yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Right so it's paul's.</p>
<p>Yeah I miss the default tags again.</p>
<p>Yes you know it's not even making the first update call.</p>
<p>Because it's happy that you know the tax are correct.</p>
<p>So seems like the checking part of the process is 100% correct.</p>
<p>So let's change games because it has to change games for it to we could just update which I guess.</p>
<p>What's the tags up.</p>
<p>That might be a quick way to do actually whatever woods do is endless cuz if we if we test it the way actually is used dry it's it's a better test.</p>
<p>Yes also whoa he's just disappeared right.</p>
<p>So what the hell's going on there.</p>
<p>Can we get this time.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And it's just a bit of a bitch but at the same time like.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes at.</p>
<p>Comfy anime gacha creative assistant.</p>
<p>That looks right to me.</p>
<p>She's floating off there we go now we can see what's happening.</p>
<p>Ok no I know what's happening that makes sense actually.</p>
<p>It's a camera issue.</p>
<p>How did the stream camera.</p>
<p>I know what's happening.</p>
<p>So we're zooming past the ai assistant.</p>
<p>Also that frame should not be on right now because we're on the runaway screen.</p>
<p>But I guess that's what happens if.</p>
<p>So we start the stream we're back to cam 0 which is correct he should show.</p>
<p>If I got to be right back he still there.</p>
<p>How many does zoom passed him on this particular screen.</p>
<p>To be fair.</p>
<p>But i'm not too worried about it it's a difficult thing to fix.</p>
<p>There are two ways to fix it we the go back to doing a render texture and put him in the thing as a canvas for a render texture and have a separate camera for him but that gets a little expensive and it's a bit of a cow are we could transition him along with the camera whenever the camera is transitioning that's also kind of awkward to set up for the very brief time that this is even a thing I don't think for right now anyway it really deserves that much of my attention.</p>
<p>Tell me come back.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He will ignore repeat messages that are the same as each other.</p>
<p>Yes back.</p>
<p>I can't see it being a scene switcher.</p>
<p>Issue.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>From like a viewer perspective.</p>
<p>I guess it's possible that some of that stuff was.</p>
<p>I guess maybe some of the.</p>
<p>Repeat it stream updates that shouldn't have been happening.</p>
<p>Somehow messed up him.</p>
<p>I really don't know I can't I still can't understand what's happening to hemingway's disappearing doesn't really make sense.</p>
<p>I'll get to the bottom of it eventually but this this is one that's really stomping me I really don't know what's happening because I run him all day yesterday and the editor in debug mode.</p>
<p>How many debug mods just the program running in the editor and he didn't do it once.</p>
<p>But he did it today.</p>
<p>At some point during wuthering wales I think and I have no idea how i.</p>
<p>I think the reason why is I don't I don't really use the chatbot that much anymore.</p>
<p>That's weird we just got a.</p>
<p>That's fine this time.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Ok it is doing lesson come.</p>
<p>And then I just zoomed in very quickly to tv.</p>
<p>And the conversation.</p>
<p>End conversation.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>How are you.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Yeah it's still not doing it.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>So when listen when listen come as activated we don't see any change in the scene which is odd.</p>
<p>End conversation.</p>
<p>Yeah it's it's hard to see whether that's working as well because we've got him set up so that he disappears like.</p>
<p>Yeah that's kind of weird i'm not sure why it's doing that.</p>
<p>That's what it should look like.</p>
<p>Wow even when I turn camera zero off.</p>
<p>Camera doesn't come in see that's not how cinemachine normally works i'm very confused.</p>
