<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Get me a nut screen.</p>
<p>Obliged.</p>
<p>Configure video.</p>
<p>Brightness.</p>
<p>Is that ok.</p>
<p>Not sponsored by volkswagen.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Play yesterday yesterday.</p>
<p>But if he was he would have noticed alright that goes fruits weren't working and he would have been like what the fuck man.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>Sort it out already.</p>
<p>Game manager for this game runs on canvas itself.</p>
<p>And you'll see within our getting manager we have a ghost parent.</p>
<p>The parent of all the little child ghosts that spooky isn't it yes children go start spooky and horror things that's why they use them.</p>
<p>Freaky.</p>
<p>Little newspaper salesman newspaper by you know good evening.</p>
<p>Yes you in the in the daily.</p>
<p>Wallop.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know there's something.</p>
<p>Scary about the ghost girls in the ghost boys I think.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know weird that is weird.</p>
<p>Supernaturally.</p>
<p>What colours are eyes and it's like.</p>
<p>Mysterious and yeah weird.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Parents.</p>
<p>Solicitors familiarise ourselves with the controls because being a while ghost parents seems to point to ghost foods which makes sense right so what is in ghost foods well it is a grid layout we can't see any of these right now probably because they're all showing empty yes they are but if we were.</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>Change the empty into a pizza we can see it basically it works the same as the food square basically.</p>
<p>Except we have the colour.</p>
<p>Turned down.</p>
<p>Put an alpha 45.</p>
<p>Alpha 45.</p>
<p>For debugging in the original one I don't know why my voice is got like this.</p>
<p>If you don't have a texture.</p>
<p>What's to white in unity so by putting food empty and we're actually giving it a transparent image essentially.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I'm not distracted me from something else I was about to do and say.</p>
<p>It's gone.</p>
<p>I'm too old to remember this.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So what we can do is we know that our ghost foods.</p>
<p>A holden ghost parent right so if we find ghost parents there's a ghost parents and we just got its declaration.</p>
<p>Type 44 I can't freaking counts 7930 leave me alone and we take two forward slashes that turns that into a comment meaning we are no longer able to reference it now what good does that do well we can see now exactly where we reference it.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>Start on an apple.</p>
<p>You basically say for each transform of ghost fruit in ghost parents.</p>
<p>Ghost foods add.</p>
<p>Fruit don't get component.</p>
<p>What does any of that mean.</p>
<p>What that means is if we go back to our game manager.</p>
<p>Ghost food stereo.</p>
<p>Essentially what this means is we tell.</p>
<p>Our system where the ghost food.</p>
<p>And then our system automatically generates.</p>
<p>All of the gospels and stars them in goes.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>Ghost foods.</p>
<p>Is the next declaration we want to turn off.</p>
<p>Gospel where is it.</p>
<p>Now this is where the real declaration comes in as you can see that caused a lot of issues now i'm going to turn ghost parent back on cos i'm happy with that.</p>
<p>Best practice actually.</p>
<p>And what were essentially want to do is just make sure that each part of the component is working correctly.</p>
<p>So if we run out again.</p>
<p>Let it phil ghost foods to make sure we're happy with it.</p>
<p>Starting at sell one we go through and we go all the way to sell 49 which I assume assume is that is the final cell.</p>
<p>Foods where do we pulling ghost foods.</p>
<p>So this is where we fill it.</p>
<p>Say coding is.</p>
<p>Opposite of.</p>
<p>Coding is the opposite to girls.</p>
<p>You feel it and then you pull them whereas see the way around anyway what was the saying.</p>
<p>Ghost foods current value at texture.</p>
<p>On ok ok.</p>
<p>This is where we add the ghost foods.</p>
<p>Are you with this this is working well.</p>
<p>All right this one here.</p>
<p>Grab index is negative 1 meaning we don't currently have anything grabs that's what this basically means it means we're not currently holding any fruits in our grubby little mix so essentially we're going to now grab the fruit so grabbed fruit equals now I know this part is working we turn ghost food place it's a true and then goes foods current sell index.txt.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>Grab food equals grid cells current cell index.</p>
<p>So we need to make sure that current sell index is lining up as well now what I had in my original original original original original original version of this but this is believe it or not this is the third migration without to do.</p>
<p>But in the original original original original original original version I made it easier to debug and what I did is I made so i'm just going to remake one now I made a.</p>
<p>What is the word i'm looking for.</p>
<p>I'm just going to call this.</p>
<p>Numbers debug.</p>
<p>I'm going to remove the image components and i'm going to add the text legacy component.</p>
<p>Is that legacy.</p>
<p>Now to sell index start counting from 0 or do we start counting from one.</p>
<p>Is the problem when you leave projects and come back to them by the way.</p>
<p>Okay i'm just going to load the original original version.</p>
<p>And check it because I genuinely can't remember.</p>
<p>I would imagine we're counting from zero.</p>
<p>But the thing that's confusing me right is if we're going off of name.</p>
<p>The weather cells was set up in the inspector is it actually start counting from zero but that was probably just me being lazy because what unity does is it makes the first version and doesn't put a number on it and then as you start duplicating it starts counting from one up.</p>
<p>But because i.</p>
<p>And then let it start counting up from there.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>It depends if you're consistently wrong that's bad you want to be consistently raised so it's a it's tricky.</p>
<p>It do be tricky.</p>
<p>Hurry up unity oh this is back in evil unity 6 I thought I liked unisex you know it should be called unity 666.</p>
<p>Remove the splash screen oh nice new logos so why don't you come in and take a look it's very seductive unit sex but when you really get down and dig underneath it's pubic hair and what you realises it's got a tiny little dick.</p>
<p>You know what I mean.</p>
<p>And we discovered another one yesterday.</p>
<p>Didn't we.</p>
<p>Ok where the hell is my debug.</p>
<p>Where is my neighbor.</p>
<p>Where can you be.</p>
<p>Are kids trim on here we go.</p>
<p>Debug numbers there we go debugger those numbers yes we are starting from zero.</p>
<p>As I suspected ok so how do we recreate this monstrosity now obviously we could go along right we could open up each one and we can type in 001 02 we'll have to do that 49 times.</p>
<p>Which takes a long time you know what's good and quick accounting.</p>
<p>Dracula.</p>
<p>One.</p>
<p>Computers are good at that.</p>
<p>Be nice.</p>
<p>So what we can do is we can such a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Numbers in wait a minute.</p>
<p>Can I just copy them from the other one.</p>
<p>Who is weekend essentially we tell it the parents right we'll just call it debug parents.</p>
<p>Which will publicly link.</p>
<p>And then yeah we from the parent will just go in and we'll just do it from the parents if we were doing anything significant with this in the long term we'd probably also want to list of these as well but there's no point and then i'm just going to stick it at the top of the program for now we're already going to delete it and essentially all i'm going to do is i'm just going to say.</p>
<p>We're going to declare an integer right we're going to say a debug index.</p>
<p>4 each.</p>
<p>Game objects.</p>
<p>Child in.</p>
<p>Parents.</p>
<p>Transform.</p>
<p>And then what we want to do is we want to say child.get components.</p>
<p>Text.</p>
<p>Dot text =.</p>
<p>Debug index.</p>
<p>Stream.</p>
<p>To a two-digit number.</p>
<p>And then we want to increment.</p>
<p>Debug index.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>And then as we run this.</p>
<p>We got a no reference exception because I forgot.</p>
<p>I always forget.</p>
<p>Numbers debug.</p>
<p>Scores in debug parents then we can hit play.</p>
<p>What the frick is going on.</p>
<p>What is going on today what is this.</p>
<p>Forage game object child in debug parents form.</p>
<p>What is wrong with hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on.</p>
<p>How is line 64.</p>
<p>Do you like that.</p>
<p>Do you like that kid.</p>
<p>Noel reference what is your freaking problem.</p>
<p>Am i.</p>
<p>Are you stupid.</p>
<p>Will child is a game objects.</p>
<p>If it's doing line 64.</p>
<p>Debug weight what missing reference exception the variable debug parents.</p>
<p>Game manager doesn't exist anymore.</p>
<p>What are you talking about looking at it right now.</p>
<p>Are you full of shit.</p>
<p>What are you banging on about.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>The variable of debug parent of game manager doesn't exist anymore.</p>
<p>You probably need to reassign the debug variable of the game manager.</p>
<p>Itunes.</p>
<p>I'm the last person you should come in for this shit.</p>
<p>Wizards of unity.</p>
<p>You know what a picture is it at some point like.</p>
<p>It becomes like I become basically they're like clown comedy show where they're like.</p>
<p>Unity wizards just sat there gone.</p>
<p>Look what he's trying to do.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>12 years later this is 12 years of learning isn't like.</p>
<p>Play started learners yesterday.</p>
<p>We're now trying to get the component on.</p>
<p>The transform so maybe we need to say.</p>
<p>I don't really know what I did wrong.</p>
<p>What did I do wrong.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Now what we can do is copy those.</p>
<p>Is that what we want to do.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Ok I know what i'm doing shut up.</p>
<p>Write 22 there we go.</p>
<p>Should I go to 49 now I didn't hear the one got a 49.</p>
<p>Full of shit 48 all the way.</p>
<p>Alright so that's.</p>
<p>Enough for me good enough for me cyndi lauper.</p>
<p>Cyndi lauper just texted me and said you know that's good enough that son.</p>
<p>No lie.</p>
<p>Do you look up your celebrity birthday.</p>
<p>Someone really impressive.</p>
<p>Cyndi lauper.</p>
<p>Dialogue so let's go back to our ghost.</p>
<p>Debug.</p>
<p>Ghost.</p>
<p>What's where are you.</p>
<p>Ghost foods where the fuck is my gospel.</p>
<p>That was.</p>
<p>Cannot navigate to the symbol under the caret.</p>
<p>Turning his freaking grave.</p>
<p>Are there kids don't know bugs bunny is these days.</p>
<p>Kids goosebumps bunny out by having a clue.</p>
<p>Can i'm old.</p>
<p>Ghost food.</p>
<p>Why can't I find gosford because I got 6 billion variables that's why.</p>
<p>Ghost foods there's the.</p>
<p>It's the one that I want.</p>
<p>There we are ok so this is what I needed to find so we basically now need to make sure the current cell index.</p>
<p>Is correct.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Working as expected so what I don't frackin understand is why isn't this happening.</p>
<p>Because we address ghost foods at the current cell index.</p>
<p>Are we set the texture to the food type grabbed food food image.</p>
<p>So this should be the point where.</p>
<p>Will it be fair on this particular.</p>
<p>It might not be current sell index it might be selected cell index I think that's the problem.</p>
<p>Cos I think current sell index is basically the cell we clicked on ryan.</p>
<p>But the thing with ghost foods is with telegraphing to the.</p>
<p>Where the foods going to end up if the player completes the.</p>
<p>I think it's something like.</p>
<p>Selected index.</p>
<p>Do I look like i'm planned.</p>
<p>Sell parents.</p>
<p>Work sell normal so much.</p>
<p>Current cell index okay here's what we're going to do we need to do a bit of reverse engineering here because clearly i'm confused about my own bloody game right so that's a bad sign so the first thing I need to know is what is current sell index is current cell index the cells that were clicking in interacting with or is current sold index always representing whatever whatever hovering over right in other words as I move around as I move my light placement around does current sell index change.</p>
<p>We can see our cell numbers now i'm going to go into my canvas do I have a txt debug now so what i'm going to do is i've got this txt honda and i've got this txt moves right this is the yellow one yeah that's the yellow one that will do will grab the yellow one and we're going to do txt debug and we're going to move it down.</p>
<p>Moving on down.</p>
<p>Move around down.</p>
<p>I'm going to.</p>
<p>Play some fast.</p>
<p>Some feedback as to what the hell is happening.</p>
<p>Shavers houses and if we go back to our game manager.</p>
<p>So football.</p>
<p>And we'll do a.</p>
<p>A reference to it.</p>
<p>That way in update i'm just going to feed back to myself.</p>
<p>At the end of october which is here.</p>
<p>Txt.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>Cell index.</p>
<p>Index.</p>
<p>The cell was sort of thinking about moving to as in does it change while we're hovering our controls around or is it.</p>
<p>Only the ones were clicking on.</p>
<p>Of course I need to remember to link it because I never do.</p>
<p>Is bloody match 3 game honestly right there we go that answers my question ok so current cell.</p>
<p>Yeah current selling decks is actually moving in real time as we're moving arms around oh yeah in case you're wondering you might be thinking why is this why does this feel weird now it doesn't always move as a movement.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>You skank.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>The reason that's happening.</p>
<p>Kiss our our debug things getting in the way right we can test that as well if we turn our debugs off there should be a lot more responsive yeah there we go.</p>
<p>Kind of it wasn't always hitting.</p>
<p>Always reacting that's because we put the numbers of the talks we have.</p>
<p>Some cord and some other shit that's getting in the way.</p>
<p>We can rip the animators off thor's and all that much.</p>
<p>My feeling with the rest of it.</p>
<p>So now we can see our cell numbers.</p>
<p>And everything's responsive we can.</p>
<p>Index is actually the one that will hovering over so it's like it's not just happening when we click on the sales ok that's good for me to know.</p>
<p>And the selling decks matches up with the numbers that we put on squares which is.</p>
<p>Imperative.</p>
<p>It's also a little bit hard to read those because.</p>
<p>Reasons.</p>
<p>Black outline to them.</p>
<p>Ok so we know that we can rely on current calendars.</p>
<p>And we know that current sell index moves as we're hovering our.</p>
<p>Squares around right.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>That kind of looks correct to me.</p>
<p>But if you think about it right when we first grab food.</p>
<p>We're not going to see it because essentially what we're going to be doing right.</p>
<p>Is let's say we have.</p>
<p>A burger.</p>
<p>And there's a burger and is our other one.</p>
<p>Delicious.</p>
<p>Ghost burger.</p>
<p>Semi-transparent.</p>
<p>Our ghost burger.</p>
<p>Is the sam's the burger right so if we place a ghost burger over the top of a real burger you ain't got to see it because it's just drawing a burger on top of a burger right the other burgers there already.</p>
<p>So the only the only way we would ever.</p>
<p>Play ghost burger as we implement it.</p>
<p>Ponder grab.</p>
<p>Would be if we remove the original burger underneath that.</p>
<p>Yeah which we actually do.</p>
<p>That's what this parts for so we say that the we say that the square in food squares.</p>
<p>We say the √ should be replaced with an empty texture and we say that ghost foods.</p>
<p>The one in gosford should be turned on turned into a ghost basically.</p>
<p>But this may not be working what i'm going to do for now is i'm just going to comment out.</p>
<p>The let's get into the habit of doing three when we want to put them back.</p>
<p>And it's easier to see.</p>
<p>So i'm just going to i'm going to take out every other part of ghost foods.</p>
<p>Placement.</p>
<p>Ok so now the only ghost foods we have is when it gets built.</p>
<p>In the list and when we grab the ghost food so i'm going to turn that back on save it and run s and then we're going to test the cells as well.</p>
<p>So if we grab.</p>
<p>Let's grab these french fries here right selling decks 22.</p>
<p>Play drink in 28 because if we move 28 to 29 we make a match right so we're going to grab 28.</p>
<p>Yeah nice working now ok so that part is working so you'll see that you'll see that the milkshake became a ghost.</p>
<p>Because it went darker.</p>
<p>Some kind of additional effect let's take a look at that actually.</p>
<p>So if these were all pizzas.</p>
<p>They would look like that.</p>
<p>But then when I was playing the game it was kinda hard to tell.</p>
<p>It was kind of hard to tell that there were ghosts we can't put outlines can we on these.</p>
<p>Use graphic how far.</p>
<p>It's kind of more obvious though that like you are.</p>
<p>Making it slightly different mean.</p>
<p>Ghost food.</p>
<p>You are so ghostly.</p>
<p>Skip this shit radio.</p>
<p>That's even better.</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to make it more obvious that like we are actually grabbing the food because it's a little I feel like it's a little bit salt but maybe that's a little bit.</p>
<p>Less salt jeremy like but.</p>
<p>Food empty.</p>
<p>That one.</p>
<p>Food.</p>
<p>We should be moving this burger.</p>
<p>This ghost burger.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>We implemented a system for that.</p>
<p>So go back to ghost foods.</p>
<p>So I can find out where it's referenced.</p>
<p>This is when we place the food we don't we don't even want to worry about this stage yet because we haven't got that far.</p>
<p>Placing the ghost food this should reset everything back that's a good one to test actually so if we decide well now we will leave that for now the one we really want to check right.</p>
<p>Is this one here ghost place show ghost placement so this is the one that should be showing the ghost food wherever the current sell index is.</p>
<p>What we essentially do as we go through each and every cell in ghost foods.</p>
<p>Reset the ghost.</p>
<p>Bells colour to go stuff which essentially makes.</p>
<p>And we go ahead.</p>
<p>And we set the empty food item to the ghost food at the current cell index.</p>
<p>That's why it's not working.</p>
<p>Ok that's why it's not working i've just found the problem.</p>
<p>Ok so if you look at what we're doing here.</p>
<p>Which means.</p>
<p>Iterate through every single item in this list.</p>
<p>We are turning the cell cells colour to go stuff.</p>
<p>What we should be doing is seeing cell dot texture because by referencing ghost foods at current cell essentially what we're doing is we're only turning off whatever the current selected cell is which was what was reflecting back up here we're only resetting that one.</p>
<p>Then we want to go into the current cell turn the ghost on and turn the ghost image to.</p>
<p>Food type food item dot food image.</p>
<p>Food type food item to food image and this takes in an integer of food item.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Let's test this.</p>
<p>To be fair that was a mistake but I don't see how that.</p>
<p>All that would have done is it would have stopped.</p>
<p>Resetting the food by putting the alpha to invisible to complete zero and we're also resetting the food by changing the texture out so even though changing the texture out was doing it on the wrong cell.</p>
<p>Are the first thing we need to do now so what are we doing now well the first thing we need to do now is make sure that code is running right.</p>
<p>Show ghost placement.</p>
<p>So what we want to do now is find out where are we calling show ghost placement.</p>
<p>Ok so we we do it in this condition here if new cell index.</p>
<p>Is not the same as current sell index.</p>
<p>Then we change current cell index to become new cell index if.</p>
<p>Ghost food places false we highlight the current cell borders otherwise.</p>
<p>Ghost placement grabbed food I also think we should also be doing that so ok.</p>
<p>So clearly the bull that were interested in.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Yeah I think we want to highlight the current cell borders and also short course placement I don't see why we should avoid highlighting the current cell board is just because we've got our ghost food place or active that doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>So the bull that were interested in is where the ghost food placer is true or false if it's true then we should be calling on show goes placement.</p>
<p>So now we need to go back to our txt debug.</p>
<p>In obsess.</p>
<p>And just check to make sure.</p>
<p>That show ghost placement.</p>
<p>Is ashley set to true when it should be so this one is called sugar's placement.</p>
<p>Which.</p>
<p>I'm just going to abbreviate to sure ghost.</p>
<p>What's what's.</p>
<p>What are you doing to me.</p>
<p>What is wrong with you on a sugar's placement was the thing on it.</p>
<p>I forgot box I forgot what it was.</p>
<p>Ghost food plaza.</p>
<p>We have more bugs.</p>
<p>We have more books.</p>
<p>Ok so ghost food places is set to true.</p>
<p>As I grabbed the burger.</p>
<p>Ok so the next thing to check is let's just make sure that our ghost foods.</p>
<p>Are actually showing over the top of the original foods.</p>
<p>Well that's not good.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So as long as we're running in as long as this is actually running.</p>
<p>Debug.log and we'll just say.</p>
<p>Ghost placer is running.</p>
<p>And actually.</p>
<p>Would be the perfect place to also echo back some of this shit that we need so what what are we taking so the one input we taken is food item.</p>
<p>So we'll talk back on food.</p>
<p>Temperature.</p>
<p>We should be grabbing that from food type.</p>
<p>So that we know what text to pull in.</p>
<p>It's basically all we need the only the only other thing I guess we use is current cylinders just in case that current cylinder is somehow.</p>
<p>Change the last minute or some weird thing like that.</p>
<p>Current cylinders.</p>
<p>All right so let's test that.</p>
<p>We are going to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>This is one nasty ass bug.</p>
<p>I don't know why the hell isn't working.</p>
<p>Ok the first thing I noticed is ghost food plaster isn't running.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Check ghost food place and never actually run.</p>
<p>Which means these conditions aren't being met.</p>
<p>Now we know the bull is correct because.</p>
<p>Report that back in debug.</p>
<p>So the only other condition that's probably not being met is new sale index is always current sell index.</p>
<p>New cell indexes always current cell index.</p>
<p>When we want the ghost plaza.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok let's look into that.</p>
<p>So in our debug text we now want to take a look at new cell index.</p>
<p>And report back on what that is.</p>
<p>Will also.</p>
<p>Showing up as a global variable.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Where does it come from.</p>
<p>Selection.</p>
<p>New cell index is just set to current calendars.</p>
<p>But essentially it may well be changed depending on what the grub condition is it looks like.</p>
<p>So we use our we use our grab step machine.</p>
<p>To make some changes to new cell index.</p>
<p>Which is why we then sunny check new sell index against current cell index.</p>
<p>So in order to debug new cylinder x.</p>
<p>Selection function we just set it at current cyl.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to know it could be that this is a default.</p>
<p>Statement here.</p>
<p>So the first thing i'm the first thing i'm going to check.</p>
<p>Is does this code ever run does this card actually have a use.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>Ok bad news we got ghost food as soon as the game starts.</p>
<p>Let's just play the game.</p>
<p>Condition wasn't there we literally just did like a big marching one.</p>
<p>Ground.</p>
<p>I don't think that conditions ever met I think that chords redundant.</p>
<p>Again it was so long ago when I put this together i'm not sure what my reason was for putting that in there in the first place.</p>
<p>What was I trying to do.</p>
<p>Yeah I mean.</p>
<p>We made how many matches do you want to make do you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Sofa with not seen the condition.</p>
<p>I think the chord is redundant I don't think you actually does anything I don't think that condition will ever be mad.</p>
<p>One things for sure it's not doing what we.</p>
<p>It's not doing what we think it's supposed to do.</p>
<p>So it seemed it seems to me like new sell indexes always gonna meet current cylinders but essentially what this section supposed to do is it supposed to let us know when ghost.</p>
<p>Placement should be.</p>
<p>Sean.</p>
<p>So what are the conditions for ghost placement supposed to be shown.</p>
<p>Well as far as I was aware it was it was the one that we put in our debug right.</p>
<p>Which was ghost food.</p>
<p>Slasher.</p>
<p>Actually I need to refer back to how did we grab the food item.</p>
<p>How do how did we know what food item to use.</p>
<p>Can you use the integer of grabbed.</p>
<p>Grabbed food.</p>
<p>So if.</p>
<p>Ghost food places.</p>
<p>Show ghost placements.</p>
<p>With grabbed food.</p>
<p>Make as far as I can tell from my understanding of how all this was how I put all this together that would be it would be as simple as that as the conditions.</p>
<p>Still not working.</p>
<p>God dammit.</p>
<p>It's still it's still seems like right let me get rid of some of these debug messages because they get very.</p>
<p>The kind of unnecessary now anyway.</p>
<p>Start part of it seems to be working fine as far as I can tell I listen to some more matches and see where else that's showing up cos it's flooding our console as well and we need to see what's happening.</p>
<p>All these iterations and cauliflower so we need to get rid of that one.</p>
<p>And that one.</p>
<p>Yes 5 seconds tell it's still not running.</p>
<p>I want a great idea why didn't I think of that.</p>
<p>Yeah it's not running it still.</p>
<p>What the fuck is going on.</p>
<p>Ok so it's yeah no of course of course of course of course of course ok.</p>
<p>Yeah because I put that conditional check.</p>
<p>In the function of move selection move selection.</p>
<p>Selection.</p>
<p>Is a telegraphing thing.</p>
<p>What does it actually apply only when we make the move let's find out again i've got this is this is reverse engineering what I want now this is what happens when you take a big break from projects.</p>
<p>Ok move selection.</p>
<p>Is move selection a telegraphing function or is it a food moving function.</p>
<p>It's neither are you kidding me what is going on this has.</p>
<p>This has to be a bug.</p>
<p>Are we seriously not even running these.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is one of these projects where i've been laz.</p>
<p>Sometimes what i'll do is i'll get scared and this is a really bad practice as well so sometimes i'll be building something and i'll write some code and it doesn't quite work but i'm i'm scared to delete the code because it like half worked or whatever and then I try a new way of doing it and then.</p>
<p>Bucks or whatever or it takes a while to get that to work and then I either forget or i'm too scared to delete the old code so sometimes so in some projects and trying to get better not doing this because it's really bad practice and this is this is the reason why so then in some of my projects i'll have these functions that are left over from like previous tests or whatever as i've been iterating that don't actually do anything but I was scared to delete the cooling case I needed to get them back or whatever the hell yeah really bad practice don't recommend it because then you end up confusing the hell out yourself because you're like ok well this thing says it moves the selection why isn't moving this selection and it's because it used.</p>
<p>Really bad.</p>
<p>Looks like.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It looks like that doesn't even do anything.</p>
<p>Is nice because if we can get rid of it.</p>
<p>You know the shot of the code gets the easier it is the debug.</p>
<p>Ok just to be safe.</p>
<p>Webgl right now.</p>
<p>There may been left over from like a previous iteration.</p>
<p>And it doesn't even do anything anymore.</p>
<p>That's what it looks like.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So let's just rip it out.</p>
<p>Yeah see that doesn't make sense right because now we've got one two three four places in our code that's saying you're.</p>
<p>What the fuck dude we need to be able to do this why did you rip it out.</p>
<p>So that's all of those areas are also redundant.</p>
<p>That does not up.</p>
<p>Where are these.</p>
<p>Ok ok ok ok.</p>
<p>No I understand now.</p>
<p>So this this project a little bit weird.</p>
<p>Ok we do need that.</p>
<p>We do need that.</p>
<p>Ok so basically what that does is that moves our selection.</p>
<p>Allows us to move our selection.</p>
<p>But it appears that.</p>
<p>A completely different functions is handling mouse control.</p>
<p>Now that's actually.</p>
<p>Can of annoying.</p>
<p>Because that means we have now that means we have two separate things to debug now.</p>
<p>It means that playing the game on gamepad and playing the game on mouse is probably pulling two separate functions to do what we need to do which is bad.</p>
<p>It's not bad but it just twice as much work.</p>
<p>So the mouse version.</p>
<p>Is not using that function at all.</p>
<p>I said I don't think it's too bad because at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So what what we need to know is that the main drivers.</p>
<p>Line up.</p>
<p>So drivers are essentially.</p>
<p>Like global variables.</p>
<p>That will drive the.</p>
<p>Current sell index is the driver.</p>
<p>For where we grabbing food and where we placing.</p>
<p>Which cell is the player interested in in.</p>
<p>Which cell is the player actually engaging with.</p>
<p>So i've turned my controller on.</p>
<p>And nothing is happening.</p>
<p>Ok why is that.</p>
<p>Where the hell is my input map.</p>
<p>March 3 input.</p>
<p>Menu of menu down menu left menu rice.</p>
<p>Menu confirm menu clause.</p>
<p>There's menu of.</p>
<p>Which is map to.</p>
<p>Currency of d-pad off.</p>
<p>That relates to gamepad control scheme not relates to keep kpm scheme.</p>
<p>Antron keyboard is confirm button south on gamepad yeah everything's set up.</p>
<p>So why.</p>
<p>The info action asset is enabled.</p>
<p>This was working in the original version it looks like something to do with the migration is broken.</p>
<p>The gamepad support for some weird reason.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's the other one that we took out.</p>
<p>Yeah I wonder if it is.</p>
<p>Try on.</p>
<p>Game manager.</p>
<p>And it was.</p>
<p>It was it was actually part of that function that we're in right now right.</p>
<p>Remove selection.</p>
<p>Mark this up.</p>
<p>Ok so move selection.</p>
<p>Movements for.</p>
<p>Only.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ok so good works perfectly on gamepad.</p>
<p>Yeah cuz that that makes sense right because I was like how could I have because i've been thinking over the past couple of days how could I have like monumentally screwed this up as bad as I have but the reason why is I actually haven't the reason why and this is why it's important to test all.</p>
<p>Situations right.</p>
<p>The reason why is when I was working on this project last time before I took a break I was I was doing what I normally do which is to test everything with the gamepad because I prefer to play with the gamepad however this games kind of different right because the mouse controls for a match 3 game are actually very very nice so since coming back to the project over the last couple of days and then fixing those other issues i've actually been playing the game with the mouse.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Yeah so ghost place is working on gamepad it's working.</p>
<p>Play the wet sponsor.</p>
<p>But where it's not working is on the mouse which is much better cuz nothing now I can get a better idea of like ok i'm not as dumb as I thought I was it's just that i've changed my control scheme and our ghost place is currently only supports gamepad and we now need to implement it for the mouse there are still issues there's like a ghost pizza left behind there and stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah what I also realise that I was between gamepad and mouse we have a discrepancy.</p>
<p>Which we want to think about whether do we want to handle.</p>
<p>Why not ok so we.</p>
<p>So here's the discrepancy.</p>
<p>When I was originally putting this together like I said I was testing it on gamepad so what i've specifically done.</p>
<p>Is i've limited the players movement.</p>
<p>Once they grab food so i've grabbed this burger.</p>
<p>Unless I want to put it to make a match 3 I can move the burger within it's range.</p>
<p>No father.</p>
<p>Good morning yourself how are you.</p>
<p>So you'll see that what i've done with the gamepad.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>I've limited the movement of a food item to up down left or right one square only.</p>
<p>Where is when we play with the mouse that limit doesn't actually apply.</p>
<p>So if I want to grab.</p>
<p>Scrubs.</p>
<p>What's the first time around the second time around since coming back to the project i've prefer to use the mouse so everything was working for controller stick me an hour and a half to realise this it's just the mouse part that's like that's a little lacking but this is good this is why it's good to sort of change control schemes and keep yourself on your toes ok but what you'll see is now that i've grabbed this burger.</p>
<p>But it's allowing me to move in all directions I can move all the way up here if I want so the first thing I want to do is I want to apply the same limitations movement limitations on the player that the game pad applies to the play with the gamepad which is the only allow the plate to move one space to the left one space to the right one space up one space down.</p>
<p>Ok so let's take a look at that.</p>
<p>I think mouse is kind of weird actually.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly there's a separate script that handles mouse.</p>
<p>And what it does is it reports back to this script about essentially which sell it's on.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Play cells.</p>
<p>Sell square will destination cell index raw number column number.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Yeah we we.</p>
<p>Play youtube's working again now youtube channel I fix some issues with boo yesterday as well.</p>
<p>Okay so yeah this is so this is basically the script that handles mouse inputs so you'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Is we essentially have re cost detectors on these.</p>
<p>I think no we don't.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>How the hell did I do this I can't even remember how I did it.</p>
<p>How did I do it.</p>
<p>There has to be some kind of trigger event on one of these sets of cells for the master.</p>
<p>Be detected on it.</p>
<p>That cost foods.</p>
<p>Image.</p>
<p>Alamanda.</p>
<p>Image.</p>
<p>Oh my god i'm genuinely stumps how would I do this.</p>
<p>How did they do this I can't remember how I did it.</p>
<p>Maybe it is handled in the.</p>
<p>Game manager.</p>
<p>But I would still need some kind of.</p>
<p>Mouse of a trigger.</p>
<p>Then handler in order to know which square is being hovered over.</p>
<p>I still think it's in here.</p>
<p>Maybe it just doesn't yeah there we go there we go.</p>
<p>Ok here we go so these things are event handlers right so basically sell square inherits not just from mono behaviour but I point to enter handler I pointer exit handler I begin drag handler and I drag handler.</p>
<p>Unity has a lot of built in event handlers that will handle mouse detection.</p>
<p>So what our cells are essentially doing it says he'll lock on point to enter which is the mouse hover game manager mouse cell enter equals cell index so essentially what we do is each one of these cells has a cell index recorded in this field here and it basically casts that back to the game manager to let the game manager know which cell is currently being covered over.</p>
<p>And then game manager does it.</p>
<p>It's like telegraphing to show what's val.</p>
<p>What's invalid moves and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And I also updates the current cell index.</p>
<p>So we're looking for a mouse sell enter.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Change within our game manager.</p>
<p>And mouse cell enter is not the same as the last mouse that was entered.</p>
<p>Then current sell index equals mouse cell enter and highlight current cell borders ok this is where we need to do it so this is where we would apply our movement limitation right because this is where we essentially change our current cell index based off wherever the cell the mouse is hovering over.</p>
<p>This is tricky.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>The reason this is tricky is because of maths.</p>
<p>Because if we're on sale zero right.</p>
<p>We can't left.</p>
<p>Can't up but we can write and we can down.</p>
<p>17 we can up left right and down so not only is every cell like unique depending on which direction the player can move in but also like the maths are kind of tricky right because.</p>
<p>We can't just say you know we can move a total of 4 cells so we can add the number for no we basically need to -1 for left plus one for right minus whatever the grid width is for up and add whatever the grid width is for down.</p>
<p>To find the destination cell.</p>
<p>Now I have that functionality for gamepad so hopefully.</p>
<p>We can.</p>
<p>Apply it to the mouse.</p>
<p>Right when we reset the grid.</p>
<p>That's kind of weird why do we say we can up down left and right on every single cell when we reset the grid.</p>
<p>That's not true.</p>
<p>If I eat transformed cell in cell parent.</p>
<p>Spell parents.</p>
<p>Is play cells so it's going into play cells.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>It would appear.</p>
<p>That I just have them all enabled which is weird.</p>
<p>Because obviously sell one which is essentially sell zero right.</p>
<p>Should be can write come down it shouldn't become left and cannot but we have those enabled anywhere so i'm guessing one of two things happens either we dynamically calculate around the borders.</p>
<p>Disable in a separate function.</p>
<p>Are we doing it on the fly.</p>
<p>Either way we're doing this dynamically it looks like.</p>
<p>Which is good news.</p>
<p>Yes you'll see when we run the program our one of our functions somewhere figures out it goes around the borders and it goes and disables the invalid.</p>
<p>Directions for each bar to sell.</p>
<p>Which is nice so we don't have to worry about that.</p>
<p>This is it's like making two games at once the goddamn.</p>
<p>I do not envy mobile phone game makers who also add like touch screen and stuff because freaking gamepad and keyboard and mouse is hard enough.</p>
<p>I can't even imagine what touch screen is like on top of that.</p>
<p>Must be a nightmare ok.</p>
<p>See the as usual right there are many many ways to make this work but the best way to make it work.</p>
<p>Is to have both systems use the same functions.</p>
<p>If you can have one function.</p>
<p>The drives both inputs.</p>
<p>Somewhere right it will affect both input schemes.</p>
<p>If you have a separate input scheme for keyboard and a separate and a separate function for mouse and a separate function for keyboard.</p>
<p>Put unifying these things in a one function is.</p>
<p>Can be kind of tricky.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine.</p>
<p>And we already know that move selection is only applying to the gamepad.</p>
<p>But now we know that move selection is essentially.</p>
<p>Two lines that are using the mouse.</p>
<p>Indexer right.</p>
<p>So that's fine if we we basically need to take those two pipes of input data and feed them into the same function so that function applies the movement limitation to both systems to both input systems.</p>
<p>And I know we already have it for gamepad.</p>
<p>The next thing I need to do.</p>
<p>Well that's the price of bitch.</p>
<p>It's a bitch because gamepads does it in in the same function that it does the telegraphing for the movement.</p>
<p>Ok let me think about this.</p>
<p>So what the game pads doing is the gamepad saying look as you're taking inputs to go up down left and right in the players moving around the board you also need to consider whether a food is currently grabbed whether you can left up down right and all this stuff it's applying all those limitations plus the movement limitation from when food is grabbed it's doing it all in the same function.</p>
<p>What the mouse is doing is the mouse is saying ok wherever you're hoverboard on the ball that's the that's where we want to tell the game manager which cell is selected and where the player is right now.</p>
<p>What time is when you grab food with the.</p>
<p>Doesn't come through the game pads function because.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Does there is doesn't as far as I can see there is no way to really marry these systems together there's no way to have one system to rule them all.</p>
<p>Well I wouldn't say there's nowhere but it would be very tricky it would mean untangling all of this shit and.</p>
<p>Feeling in a brand new systems I just don't know whether it's worth doing unless chachi bt can help me do it.</p>
<p>I still know that it would be worth it.</p>
<p>If grab index is -1 that means we don't have any food right now.</p>
<p>It just makes things it makes things easy to manage it makes things easier to change it reduces stuff like spaghetti called it just it makes things so much better but it can be a real pain in the ass that woman.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to get my head around how would I even do it.</p>
<p>Because essentially.</p>
<p>It's because the mouth like the mouse.</p>
<p>Very different systems write the mouse and obviously what a gamepad is essentially doing or even a keyboard is essentially doing is your iterating through numbers right you're saying you know I don't know I move right one space right up one space down one space so the number changes just like one.</p>
<p>1 squared and on a completely different square so the mouse is just basically if you imagine like.</p>
<p>If you imagine like a bird's eye view this is kind of how it works actually it's called red casting essentially what it does is if you're imagining a layers you might know those layers of pointers imagine you're hovering over the grid from a bird's eye view and wherever you are you just pointing a laser straight down wherever that lays it happens to hit.</p>
<p>And that's kind of how the mouse works.</p>
<p>Because those are two very very different system.</p>
<p>What is linear and one is kind of more.</p>
<p>As well.</p>
<p>It's very hard to.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p>Merge those two systems together I might.</p>
<p>But yeah also there's something there's something very different that happens as well with the with the gamepad.</p>
<p>That I think I i want I want to repeat that functionality yeah I do need I need do you need to try and figure this out though because he is another discrepancy that i've just thought of.</p>
<p>Ok so there are two mods right.</p>
<p>So if you if you look at these highlighted borders right which sure you where you can move.</p>
<p>You can think of that ass like the games kind of you know.</p>
<p>Potential moves hinting system which is exactly what it is and it's also kind of hinting to you how far you can move an.</p>
<p>And it does the same thing on gamepad which is nice.</p>
<p>However the other the other discrets with gamepad is let's move this burger over here as I grab the burger.</p>
<p>And I move the burger you'll notice that the cross the grid of the cross that's showing you the movement space because this is how I wanted it to work.</p>
<p>It stays in the same place and only the food moves because I think that's a better effect right because essentially you now moving sorry because now I essentially I now move this burger into a valid green square and as a player you know you'll quickly make that connection and you'll be like okay I always want to aim for the green square but if you move the cross with the food which is what the mouse is doing at the moment if you move the cross with the food then you no longer moving the food at the green square cuz the green square would move one space to the left with the burger and then also the green squares now light are you because the greens if the green square means you know a valid destination square which is what it's supposed to mean then if the green square goes under that drink there it's no longer true right the drink and the bug is not make a match of burgers for example so I love how it works on gamepad because I you know I made it work exactly the way I wanted it so on gamepad but with the mouse.</p>
<p>That's something else that I need to figure out with the mouse because with the mouse as soon as I grab the burger and I move over to the right the cross comes with me first of all we need to get the bloody burger cuz we haven't figured that out yet but so we we want the same functionality we want the burger.</p>
<p>Hounds.</p>
<p>This is so difficult.</p>
<p>I think I need I think I need chachi pities help with.</p>
<p>I don't even know if chachi pt is going to be able to do this.</p>
<p>I mean the first thing to do is to filter it out to say whether we are holding a burger on a food ghost place or whatever the hell or I am.</p>
<p>So what we would do.</p>
<p>Right so this is basically.</p>
<p>Is is the player hovering over.</p>
<p>Really it's mouse cell selection so this is is the player hovering over a cell that they won't previously hovering over on the last frame if so at the moment we simply just retali graft to them where they can move bloody bloody blah blah but the first the first way to split this is to say if there's a few ways of doing this we've got a couple of different systems that actually do this.</p>
<p>The one we should probably use is if grab index.</p>
<p>Is not.</p>
<p>-1 meaning.</p>
<p>The play currently doesn't have any food in their possession and they are just that they're looking for telegraph moves.</p>
<p>Essentially.</p>
<p>And then we can do the else so this this is the bit we're trying to implement here if we've this is if we've grabbed food if we've grabbed food.</p>
<p>Our current cell index still wants to be mouse cell enter.</p>
<p>But it needs to be within the limit of.</p>
<p>Where.</p>
<p>Where the food was grabbed from actually that's another thing ok so we probably have yeah let me think about this we probably have a reference we'd have to really.</p>
<p>We must have a reference from where the food was grabbed from.</p>
<p>So actually I think grab index.</p>
<p>Is where the food was grabbed from.</p>
<p>Grabs food is the type of food that was grabbed.</p>
<p>Insure ghost placer is a toggle a flag to say whether we need to show god's plasma of new food which would always be true if we grab the food so.</p>
<p>Human brain figure out what the fuck i'm supposed to be doing right.</p>
<p>So if.</p>
<p>So highlight current sell borders we don't actually want to do.</p>
<p>So I think we just want to say current sell index equals mouse cell enter and then we need to impose limits on that.</p>
<p>So let me just start with that one simple change.</p>
<p>And see if that is closer to the effect that we want.</p>
<p>I think it will be.</p>
<p>That actually broke everything.</p>
<p>Grab index is -1.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>So let's grab the burger.</p>
<p>Getting what we want.</p>
<p>The next thing we need to do though is right so the moment we can still change our selling decks where beyond the bounds of where we're supposed to move.</p>
<p>Fix that.</p>
<p>And also.</p>
<p>We're not we're not showing the ghost food either we're not moving the ghost food.</p>
<p>So let's just.</p>
<p>If you want to call it that.</p>
<p>So we can now move the food into.</p>
<p>The barber cells.</p>
<p>Movements.</p>
<p>Want to show ghost.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>Current sale index.</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Can we just use your ghost.</p>
<p>Placements.</p>
<p>Unwrapped food.</p>
<p>Yes that's let's go with that.</p>
<p>Used.</p>
<p>Okay issues though yeah we still have an imposed limits but look at this it's almost there we almost done it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I am learning.</p>
<p>I'm definitely learning.</p>
<p>I'm definitely getting better with this.</p>
<p>This bit scares me though.</p>
<p>Cos we need to impose the limits.</p>
<p>Well let's take a look to see how our gamepad handled it because it was a while ago and I got I need to like refresh my memory.</p>
<p>How did our gamepad do it.</p>
<p>Move selection for gamepad if grab index.</p>
<p>Is grab something.</p>
<p>We say if direction is vector to up and current cell can of the new cell index - = grid cell.</p>
<p>Where is vector 2 coming from.</p>
<p>Vector 2 direction.</p>
<p>Ok vector 2 direction.</p>
<p>I'll be honest chat gbt road some of this code for my gamepad which is why i'm not as confident as I should be because i'm still a little hazy on how it's doing some of the stuff what i'm a little the only thing i'm really a little bit hazy on is how I assume it's I understand what a vector 2 is right so a vector 2 is basically a two-dimensional.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Essentially a vector 2 is used for starring directions of up down left and right.</p>
<p>Space in three dimensional space and directions and 3 dimensional space.</p>
<p>So I think so what happens with a gamepad.</p>
<p>Is because game development uses vector 2 quite a lot for up down and left and rights because the two-dimensional thing now like modern game pads will actually transmit numbers indoors formulas so that they can be sort of passed straight to other controls this is the thing i'm a little bit hairy on.</p>
<p>So either one of two things is either happening either the codashop is essentially passing the vector to information that sent directly from the gamepad and the gamepad saying hey this is my up down left and right and he is the numbers that represent that or it's essentially turning the direction from the the listeners into something that that resembles that.</p>
<p>Mouse works differently.</p>
<p>The mouse is the mouse doesn't like the mouse doesn't really know if it's moving up down left or right it just knows I suppose it probably does on some level but like it just kind of knows.</p>
<p>Which screen location it's on any given frame at least the game engine does.</p>
<p>As far as i'm aware.</p>
<p>So I don't know how we would translate a mouse into a vect.</p>
<p>So i'm going to.</p>
<p>Clarify for me how the hell I might be able to do this ok.</p>
<p>I am making a match 3 game.</p>
<p>It supports.</p>
<p>Mouse and gamepad.</p>
<p>For gamepad.</p>
<p>I am using vector 2.</p>
<p>Do limit the players movement.</p>
<p>Once food is grabbed.</p>
<p>Buy one space.</p>
<p>Up down left right.</p>
<p>I need to.</p>
<p>Reflect this limit.</p>
<p>In my mouse movements.</p>
<p>Not sure how to.</p>
<p>Write that efficiently.</p>
<p>So that's my mouse.</p>
<p>Ok let's see what it comes back with.</p>
<p>To officially apply the movement constrain so you're using for gampa to mouse best movement you'll need to implement a method that calculates the direction of movement from the grabbed foods initial position and the mouse is current position ok.</p>
<p>Give me the direction calculate the direction of the movement based on the difference between the initial grub position which is grab index and the current mouse position which is current sell index.</p>
<p>Apply movement constraints use this direction to determine whether the movement is valid and if it's if it's if it is update the position otherwise reset to the previous valid position.</p>
<p>So the changes it suggests.</p>
<p>Is to make a new function interesting move selection with mouse to new functions and one call calculate direction.</p>
<p>Interesting so it's closed my update because it doesn't understand that I didn't give it the whole of that so i'm just going to put in the part that we need.</p>
<p>Which is.</p>
<p>Kill it direction and move selection with mouse which is two functions we're going to need to put in now.</p>
<p>See if it works.</p>
<p>And I want to see how it's doing out.</p>
<p>Ok so on calculate direction it's taking two integers which is a start selling decks and a target cell index.</p>
<p>It declares an insecure of delta x.</p>
<p>Which is target sell index.</p>
<p>And it's using percent grid size - start cell index percent grid size I have no idea what that does.</p>
<p>That's kind of nuts.</p>
<p>Okay play some.</p>
<p>9% I think percent applies limits it like it applies weird caps to numbers what essentially percent does if I remember correctly is it says I want you to calculate these numbers within the range of whatever range I give you so I think percent.</p>
<p>Essentially says you're going to figure out the selling decks but it must be within the confines of the grid size.</p>
<p>I think that's what that does.</p>
<p>An in delta wise target sell index divided by grid size.</p>
<p>Is 1 then the then the direction is right if the if the delta x comes back is negative 1 and the direction is left if delta y is 1 then the direction is up and if direction if delta y is negative 1 the direction must be down.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>And then it's made a function called move selection with mouse which takes a vector 2 of the direction that we just calculated.</p>
<p>And based on that direction.</p>
<p>It's the ui accordingly.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What's tester.</p>
<p>Scary stuff.</p>
<p>This is scary stuff.</p>
<p>It didn't work.</p>
<p>Are ghosts placements.</p>
<p>Is completely off.</p>
<p>It's showing the ghost placement on the left solar as I hover over this one so I don't know what the fuck that's about.</p>
<p>And also I think like let me see I need to bring my debug numbers up.</p>
<p>I think I think it's fucking up current cells selected index.</p>
<p>So let's grab this burger here on cell 8.</p>
<p>Ok current sell index is showing as 9.</p>
<p>But it also shows us night now.</p>
<p>And it's showing 8 when we hover over 7 and it's showing one as we hover over 15.</p>
<p>So that did not work.</p>
<p>I did not work.</p>
<p>I think it will work I think I think it's just misunderstanding something about the way my cells work.</p>
<p>So when we do a calculate direction let's just do a unity debug and see what's happening.</p>
<p>Direction.</p>
<p>Calc plus.</p>
<p>Return.</p>
<p>Return vector to don ray's.</p>
<p>I think I need to just put.</p>
<p>What it found in there like this.</p>
<p>Will that also do that.</p>
<p>I think only if I do that right.</p>
<p>Yeah I think so.</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>And then I want to add the debug.</p>
<p>In front of a.</p>
<p>I don't want to do the same.</p>
<p>As well.</p>
<p>Cos i'm curious if the direction is being calculated.</p>
<p>First of all.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok let's see if it's getting the direction right.</p>
<p>Ok so we grab the pizza.</p>
<p>We got right.</p>
<p>Calculates right which is correct.</p>
<p>We got down and it says.</p>
<p>Ok we can fix that door.</p>
<p>Set left came back is left and i'm guessing what's going to go down yeah so open down the wrong way around.</p>
<p>So we can we can change those.</p>
<p>Like that because then we don't have to change it twice their right.</p>
<p>So let's grab all burger.</p>
<p>Left.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>Down.</p>
<p>What I think these numbers.</p>
<p>How many issues with the hover detection so i'm just going to try turning those off.</p>
<p>Smooth now.</p>
<p>See if it's working.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Will it kind of does but it's it's weird.</p>
<p>It seems very slow.</p>
<p>Turn on something that right now.</p>
<p>It's still not quite working correctly is that.</p>
<p>Directions and i'll calculating correctly.</p>
<p>Okay our directions are now correct cos I fix.</p>
<p>But I don't think our sell selections are coming back.</p>
<p>Let's meet debug it and also oh there we go.</p>
<p>No that's fine ok so let's grab these french fries.</p>
<p>So we've got selling decks of 10.</p>
<p>The food.</p>
<p>It goes to 17 which is correct.</p>
<p>Are you know it might be it might be the ghost placement isn't.</p>
<p>Isn't being applied yeah it doesn't get applied until we move off it ok I think it's just cuz it's not being called ok we can fix that.</p>
<p>I'm happy with the directions now right the directions are working so I just need to make sure they line up with what we said so we basically inverted up and down.</p>
<p>So let's invert up and down from its original card.</p>
<p>And then we'll get rid of this debugger version.</p>
<p>It's a pretty cool function.</p>
<p>So what's happening I think.</p>
<p>If grab index is greater than -1.</p>
<p>Then the first thing i'm going to do is say sure ghost placement.</p>
<p>On grabbed food.</p>
<p>Because we fall into a different function right.</p>
<p>Essentially once we've grabbed the food now we fall into a different function and that function isn't showing the ghost placement so if we call the ghost placement function within their.</p>
<p>I think that's the only thing that's not working now cos I was selling decks is lining up I was still in this wasn't lining up before so I thought it was completely broken but it's because the directions up and down were invert.</p>
<p>So if we grab these french fries 24.</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>It seems to show the ghost food.</p>
<p>When I move away from it so if I move back to 24 that's when the ghost food shows up.</p>
<p>But yeah that's also that didn't update the.</p>
<p>It's not like it's not very responsive what the hell is going on now.</p>
<p>Let me turn the numbers off in case the numbers are getting in the way again.</p>
<p>I don't think they are to be honest I smooth this pizza.</p>
<p>Yeah it's not updating the cell.</p>
<p>So the question now is.</p>
<p>Is it our cold.</p>
<p>Or is it the mouse detection I mean that's all called but you're not I mean which code is it.</p>
<p>So we can check that by looking at mouse cell enter is mouse cell enter updating.</p>
<p>That drink.</p>
<p>Mouse salad or is changing just as responsively as it always does but our ghost food is just like it feels buggy there's something something's not right with that.</p>
<p>Stop working properly.</p>
<p>But the good news is if we turn numbers debug on right.</p>
<p>Even when we grab the food.</p>
<p>I was selling decks is changing there's 23.</p>
<p>Oh it's not quite the weather.</p>
<p>17 yeah ok I was sell index is not updating.</p>
<p>Or something.</p>
<p>With the mouse.</p>
<p>So if grab index.</p>
<p>If we have food grab then we fall into here.</p>
<p>So we go ahead and we calculate the direction.</p>
<p>And then we say move selection with mouse.</p>
<p>So we have to think about the order that things are happening in as well right so the first thing that's happening is we say.</p>
<p>Oh I know why I know why.</p>
<p>Ok I know why.</p>
<p>So what we do it's very responsive when we're not grabbing food because what we do is we set current cell index to mouse cylinder so that this thing basically is updated the changes can be detected efficiently however what we did is nrl statement we just go ahead and do the directions and the gospel placement and all the other side right.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't even think we need two ghost placements now I mean.</p>
<p>I don't think we need that one there because we already do it in.</p>
<p>Move selection with mouse now.</p>
<p>So I think this was what was causing the issue because essentially when we're highlighting the cell borders we make sure that new detections can be updated by updating that variable but we weren't doing it when food was grabbed so I think that's why it's suddenly went all buggy and weird when we grabbed food so if we grab these fries.</p>
<p>However ok we are back but we're also not.</p>
<p>Because the limits aren't being imposed.</p>
<p>The limits aren't being imposed.</p>
<p>Okay so we fix the responsiveness.</p>
<p>It might be.</p>
<p>See this is why i'm glad ok let me find out this is very very weird.</p>
<p>Broken.</p>
<p>It's working and it's not it's weird.</p>
<p>Ok direction came back as left.</p>
<p>Direction came back is down direction came back as up.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>We're still able to take our gosford way out of bounds.</p>
<p>Whereabouts.</p>
<p>But we know directions are working still.</p>
<p>And they are correct.</p>
<p>I think ok.</p>
<p>I think what's happening right is we use we use our normally works right is we using whatever sell the players hovering over as the currently like selected cell right.</p>
<p>What world but it's not like it's not selected in game so like ok think of it as like.</p>
<p>It's like hovering over button and then pressing a button right.</p>
<p>Which button are we hovered over so normally what we do is we take we take that value.</p>
<p>What's happening.</p>
<p>Write the next test I need to test cos what could be happening right is the.</p>
<p>Our current selected cell is being.</p>
<p>Within the movement ranch but we're simply seeing the telegraphing which is like the visual elements.</p>
<p>I don't like essentially the representation of what the play can do isn't lining up with.</p>
<p>What's the internal systems the same to play I can do so let's test it I grab these fries at 24 I can take them to 31 which is correct if I try and take them to 38.</p>
<p>I'm going to give it.</p>
<p>I want to give it this chord back.</p>
<p>Open downloaded but upon fixing that the directions now return correctly but the player is still able to move the gosford outside of the playable range of one space of time left to right to ensure the play can't move the ghost food outside of the allowable range of one space in any direction you need to implement.</p>
<p>Stupid stupid.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>What the hell did you give me before then.</p>
<p>Here's what he's chat gpt right you say chachi bt i'm asthmatic and i'm having an asthma attack I need an inhaler and it goes yes inhaling can certainly help with breathing issues you know inhaling has been done for thousands of years by tribes from the inhaler region of the inhaling tribe many things can be in hell such as glue gas weed you know I mean it goes on and on about inhaling and then you like no I need an inhaler i'm having an asthma attack and it's like.</p>
<p>You may want to consult your doctor and ask him for a diagnosis remember always you know trust professionals over chat gpt any like no no i'm not asking you if I asked my i'm telling you I have asthma i'm having an asthma attack and I need an inhaler.</p>
<p>Why don't you why didn't you ask me for an inhaler and it's like that's what you need and then you like oh my fucking.</p>
<p>It's like gaslight ultimate gaslight gpd.</p>
<p>Why didn't you just ask me for an inhaler in the first place you dumbass it's like I fucking did.</p>
<p>Selection.</p>
<p>This is the most difficult game i've ever tried to make in uni I can't believe how hard it is to make much.</p>
<p>Billions that they have I swear to god.</p>
<p>Deserve every penny.</p>
<p>How much time it's like what the fuck is like i'm like 3 weeks in and i'm like ready to jump out the window i'm like oh my god I got this work.</p>
<p>It is such a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>But I had a feeling it would be tricky I think tricky was the word I was thinking yeah that might be a bit tricky actually but like holy crap.</p>
<p>Not like mission impossible.</p>
<p>Play once again.</p>
<p>Sell index isn't changing at all.</p>
<p>As I hover my mouse the only thing that's happening is the direction is coming back.</p>
<p>Check is too restrictive.</p>
<p>Good god when's the I going to be good can we get a good one of these.</p>
<p>Why did that look weird.</p>
<p>Oh my god move didn't I couldn't move or the.</p>
<p>Something something feels not right about that.</p>
<p>There's something off about that is that.</p>
<p>I don't know the felt it feels I don't why does it feel weird posting that particular function back in feels weird it feels like the code is like it's moving the chords somehow.</p>
<p>Silent ok it did update it to sell an excellent again it's taken the ghost show ghost food out.</p>
<p>To be fair it doesn't know that I removed it from the other place so maybe we should put it back in the other place because then if it's still needs to fuck with it right then we do it here instead so we could do move select selection with mouse and then show ghost placement wrapped food.</p>
<p>After we've done that function and then it can fuck with that function as much as it once and it doesn't.</p>
<p>Take out god's placement out.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>To be fair it's sort of working that's kind of not not wait.</p>
<p>It doesn't let me move it the cell 6.</p>
<p>It does eventually just takes a while.</p>
<p>What do you mean when told devastation now woman can you not see if you're not been watching the stream you wouldn't come what would you call this if you don't call it told devastation.</p>
<p>Oh my god help.</p>
<p>Why is this so difficult.</p>
<p>Grab those fries.</p>
<p>It feels like it either it either does absolutely nothing and in my game looks like it like if if I can looks like it's working yet it's not the imposing any of the limits whatsoever and if I can't move it all.</p>
<p>Rising the limit.</p>
<p>Chachi bt i'm getting mad now i'm ready getting mad.</p>
<p>I'm not smart enough to do this.</p>
<p>Move selection with mouse vector 2 direction in new cylinder = current cylinder x cell square current cell equals grid cells at current cell index.</p>
<p>If direction is vector 2 up.</p>
<p>And current cell can up the new cell index.</p>
<p>I'm actually going to kill it.</p>
<p>Is it within one cell range.</p>
<p>Was it that the new selling taxes within one cell from the grabbed index is within one cell range.</p>
<p>Which is a private pool.</p>
<p>Rice which says original index.</p>
<p>Which it uses is grabbing deck.</p>
<p>Correct and you index.</p>
<p>Good fucking god this is insane.</p>
<p>Yeah I like I can see where it's headed but clearly doesn't fucking work.</p>
<p>Like yeah that's I guess that's kind of what it needs to do.</p>
<p>Like I need to know whether this bull let's find if this bill is running first.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Space is running that's kind of what this function does.</p>
<p>Is that even running.</p>
<p>I'm getting towards the end of my time now I told you i've said this before right here's how coding in unity works for me from my perspective it's probably not like this for anybody else but this is how it works for me.</p>
<p>Nothing means anything whatsoever unity is an illusion doesn't even really exist.</p>
<p>It really does is it it has me pull my.</p>
<p>Entire being.</p>
<p>I'm almost there so it's going to start working soon what are unity does is it basically has me.</p>
<p>Bang my head against the brick wall until i'm literally one leg hanging out the window and then it'll just start doing it.</p>
<p>Designed to do is to push me to the very end edge of my son at me and then it will start actually working properly.</p>
<p>It works in collaboration with with chat gpd.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>Grab that drink.</p>
<p>Up.</p>
<p>Check is one spaces running.</p>
<p>Okay we go up higher right to 10 and it says check is one space is running.</p>
<p>So I would so it seems like.</p>
<p>So it sounds like.</p>
<p>It sounds like is.</p>
<p>Is within one cell range.</p>
<p>Coming back.</p>
<p>Incorrectly let's find out if that's what's happening.</p>
<p>I need to tell chap gpt what it's doing wrong otherwise it's just going to gaslight me all day long.</p>
<p>So i'll do a debug.log.</p>
<p>Is in range.</p>
<p>Else.</p>
<p>Debug.log.</p>
<p>Is not in range let's put nuts in capitals.</p>
<p>The worst part is as well like I get it gets me to the point where i'm like let's just forget it for today and let's go play anything like get to the point where i'm looking forward to playing wuthering waves because i'm like you know what i'd rather play with and that's when you know it's getting bad you know it's bad when you think you know what I just play with her and waves but the problem with that is it took me an hour and a half the first hour and a half of the stream was me catching up.</p>
<p>Exactly the first hour and a half of today's stream was me relearning how this originally worked in the first place so essentially cost me an hour and a half to walk away the last time I walked away but to be fair the last time I walked away because I didn't realise at the time but unity 6 was screwing up everything and it was a unit 6 bug.</p>
<p>Okay search coming back is not in range.</p>
<p>And yet it's updating the current cell index.</p>
<p>Ok so that means one of two things this is actually helpful ok so that's saying oh but it's always saying it's not in range.</p>
<p>Not only is it saying that nothing is in range.</p>
<p>It's not applying the range limitation thinking that it's not in range anywhere so not only is it wrong about what range it's in it's also not capable of applying the range limitation.</p>
<p>What this does tell me something.</p>
<p>It tells me that either some or the function is overriding the telegraphing when it thinks it's not in range.</p>
<p>Or just the code to chachi pt sent me so fucking utterly useless it just doesn't do what it's supposed to do in the first place it's one or the other now my prediction is the latter and the reason why is one of its demented versions that it gave me wouldn't let me move at all and none of the telegraphing was occurring so if some of the function was giving me the effect right that I can move when I can't then it would have applied their but it didn't so that's why I think that the latest the latest piece of code that it gave me is about as much use.</p>
<p>Is paimon at a fucking weight watchers convention.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>Play star rejected it.</p>
<p>31 wondering about errors happening with the play store version google play store rejected our new update.</p>
<p>Of the images.</p>
<p>Resources are inappropriate we also met the same problem when posting version 2.1 pv in youtube urgently communicating with google staff to solve the problems soon as possible however now we are sorry to tell you we cannot provide the newest version update to google play users if possible we suggest google play players using other.</p>
<p>Epoch official pc and I asked for all players one stop for korean players only to.</p>
<p>Are indian data are interconnected we will send compensations based on the delayed release time will we get that conversation.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised fucking.</p>
<p>Walk baby fucking google.</p>
<p>What the hell ok she's wearing a white dress I think it's just very.</p>
<p>Very close to the skin colour.</p>
<p>Incredibly dodgy.</p>
<p>If I send you my if I send you my unity project will you fix it for me.</p>
<p>I'm kind of.</p>
<p>I'll be right by.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Let's go to our.</p>
<p>What we're going to do.</p>
<p>Is it going to make a public.</p>
<p>List.</p>
<p>Have images.</p>
<p>Valid move cells.</p>
<p>What we're going to do.</p>
<p>Is as we grab food.</p>
<p>With the mouse.</p>
<p>Marcus we're going to the restaurant tomorrow are we.</p>
<p>Move selection with mouse.</p>
<p>Calculate direction.</p>
<p>Things i'm just going to call a function called move selection with mouse.</p>
<p>So let's go to the move selection with mouse.</p>
<p>And we need to make sure this is running.</p>
<p>When it's supposed to be running so first of all i'm just going to make a debug message that says my move code is running.</p>
<p>Cast gpt socks.</p>
<p>Alexa's.</p>
<p>We're not holding any valid cells and if we look at our.</p>
<p>Hear this is why I did this.</p>
<p>We can take a look at the numbers and we can just work it out ourselves right.</p>
<p>So we simply we can say our right and we don't need to worry about the canopy down borders thing because that's already implemented and with the mouse it doesn't matter anyway because you can't hover over a border you can't hover over a square that doesn't exist so we don't need to worry about all that is up down left right with the mouse that's the beauty of the mouse you don't have to worry about that with gamepad because you're telling the gamepad which square you're going to move to and if the square doesn't exist then you're going to get no references.</p>
<p>Houses to the other way around.</p>
<p>Play gamepad you don't really do anything you just press the direction and then it moves something on the interface with the mouse to see the way around you hover over something on the interface and then that tells the game where the player wants to be so it's almost like the reverse of itself right which is why this is such a pain in the ass so valid move cells clear and then we're just going to say.</p>
<p>Are valid moves cell is one up one down one left and one right so we want to save valid move cells.</p>
<p>Current selection.</p>
<p>Current sell index - 1.</p>
<p>Because if we're let's take cell 24 as our example cell right if we're on cell 24 are burgers on cell 24 we should be able to move it to 23:25 17 and 31 so we want 1 - 1.</p>
<p>What's one one.</p>
<p>Which is.</p>
<p>Plus the grid size right.</p>
<p>1 - the grid size.</p>
<p>First one.</p>
<p>So in our case our grid.</p>
<p>What's 7.</p>
<p>If we're at 25 to get to 32 we should be able to add 7 and it should bring.</p>
<p>25.</p>
<p>+ 7 is indeed 32 perfect and then obviously it's going to be the other direction if we minister so now we have a list of valid cells that we should be able to move to.</p>
<p>Actually this is wrong.</p>
<p>Already you know why because the current sell index is just where our mouse is hovering we actually want to use the grab index which is the index we grab the original food from.</p>
<p>Because then we're going to be comparing current grab index current sell index against these valid move cells so that all we have to do is say hey is the current selected cell one of these valid cells if it is go ahead and telegraphic if not.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>So where's our valid cells.</p>
<p>Where the hell is my valid cells txt doug.</p>
<p>Did I not save it or something what the hell.</p>
<p>Valid move cells.</p>
<p>Where's my valid move songs.</p>
<p>It should be underneath throat.</p>
<p>Should be it should be in between throw objects.</p>
<p>Throw.</p>
<p>Okay okay to be fair it just didn't show when I thought it would it actually showed up.</p>
<p>Which is fine.</p>
<p>But yeah we got 1618 which is correct 24 and 10.</p>
<p>Yeah it did it slightly in a slightly different order I would rather it does 10:24.</p>
<p>So will invert it doesn't really matter but it just like from a human perspective I think it makes more sense to do left right then up then down.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>That's a good sign that something saying is happening now again.</p>
<p>All right then all we need to do is we need to say.</p>
<p>Cells appear.</p>
<p>Shut off.</p>
<p>Rice what i'm going to do is i'm going to get i'm going to make an integer of current cell and let me think about that.</p>
<p>This is kind of tricky but the reason this is tricky is this still isn't really working where I would like it to work and the reason why.</p>
<p>Is because.</p>
<p>The words working at the moment is it's building the list of valid cells as we move on to a different cell.</p>
<p>Let me just test something.</p>
<p>I fear was still going to run into problems because.</p>
<p>None of our chord is telling it to do the ghost what we do we do do a course placement by default don't we.</p>
<p>Ok that's true so right now it's letting me put ghost food wherever I want.</p>
<p>Yeah but that's because that's because we run this program yeah ok we run our code and then we place the gospel so it should be fine yeah it's ok I think I was worried that what was going to happen is that was going to override our limits that we were setting but no because we visit this function first then we place the then we put the ghost place on so all we need to do is correct the current cylinder.</p>
<p>But then the question is well what are we what are we correcting the current cell ind.</p>
<p>I think the obvious answer is just to put it back to the grab index so what we're going to do is we're going to say.</p>
<p>Ends index equals 0 while index is less than valid move cells.com.</p>
<p>We're going to increment through the index.</p>
<p>Am I going to ask.</p>
<p>If current selling.</p>
<p>Is the same as valid move cells.</p>
<p>In position index.</p>
<p>Then is valid becomes true.</p>
<p>And then when we come out of that loop if it's a valid cylinder essentially we don't do anything.</p>
<p>So instead we'll say if it is not valid if this if this selection is invalid then we're going to reset current cell index back to grabbed index.</p>
<p>I'm going to place the ghost.</p>
<p>Back where the original food came from essentially telegraphing to the player no.</p>
<p>You men not put your food that you're naughty boy.</p>
<p>All right let's see if it works.</p>
<p>Our girl.</p>
<p>From our gospel singer but there you go we've imposed our move limit on the mouse we can no longer take it all the way out here we can't move diagonally and if we try and move to an invalid place it just jumps back to where it originally was.</p>
<p>Which I think I think is fine I think that feels good actually I think that looks fine.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I'm very pleased now that doesn't need to be a publicly exposed field we can make that private.</p>
<p>We could even do it during the runtime to be honest.</p>
<p>So now we know that's working cos we do have a lot of shit in our inspector that we don't need.</p>
<p>In fact if I just copy that remove it it will warn me.</p>
<p>Doesn't exist in the current context but we can just declare it here instead.</p>
<p>And and do it grab it when we need it make it when we need it.</p>
<p>I'm just test it make sure it's still working.</p>
<p>Grab that soda.</p>
<p>Yeah it's working fine.</p>
<p>Brilliance.</p>
<p>Ok so the only other place.</p>
<p>That we took it out of so are happy with this we want to put this back in actually we don't use direction do we should get rid of it.</p>
<p>In san lines are called that we don't even use.</p>
<p>Never mind I mean.</p>
<p>Do you know man's a tiny little you know.</p>
<p>Little unintrusive little thing which is what you want you want a little maggot of cord.</p>
<p>Find anyone.</p>
<p>What a joke.</p>
<p>Raise.</p>
<p>So there we go.</p>
<p>Which was place food.</p>
<p>If that.</p>
<p>I'm so happy.</p>
<p>3 hours.</p>
<p>It is working perfectly.</p>
<p>I'm so pleased.</p>
<p>Absolutely perfect.</p>
<p>Bloody perfect that is.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I'm exhausted.</p>
<p>We're still not done so now what we need to do is we're doing the matches the food's getting thrown to pie i'm on we could quickly that would be pretty easy actually at the moment when payment gets the food she's got an animation on it you'll see here if we're going to wear on a man.</p>
<p>Amazon prime on.</p>
<p>So another thing I know this is.</p>
<p>The food now on time on perfectly.</p>
<p>Are there any reason it wasn't before is because of a.</p>
<p>Coordinates.</p>
<p>It's a great engine jesus god I hope they fucking fix.</p>
<p>Do you want to know something in all honesty I think what I would hope for.</p>
<p>Depends how heavily.</p>
<p>Is really based on unity right.</p>
<p>They've got the money.</p>
<p>I don't know why they don't just well actually I do know why they don't buy it because.</p>
<p>Eventually I think maybe it would prefer itself.</p>
<p>You've got a wonder cos they must be paying right now they're paying unit you boot load because the shirt like they have to share profits with them and shit well I don't know whether they do actually cuz I think that's only part of the unit 6 pricing plan yes I probably not actually.</p>
<p>Out from under unity.</p>
<p>Yeah it's probably just it's probably wouldn't be like.</p>
<p>Financially viable for them.</p>
<p>But would they compete with unity again legally that might be difficult because if the it sounds like what they're going to do is just basically you know make it as make it not not unity enough to just get out of paying the licence fee but it's probably still so unity that it's if they released as a public engine it probably get sued I would think.</p>
<p>What I want to do is I want to.</p>
<p>Remove the food that gets thrown at home on a little bit quicker because it lands on her.</p>
<p>Where what happened.</p>
<p>Cos we're not doing.</p>
<p>I think what it might be is it's reaching a destination sooner than it's supposed to.</p>
<p>So what we could do is we could say if the object.</p>
<p>Transform the position.</p>
<p>Is destination.</p>
<p>Yield return new wet for.</p>
<p>0.1 second.</p>
<p>Send destroy.</p>
<p>Play the object.</p>
<p>Is it kind of sits on a mouth a little bit too long.</p>
<p>What's the disappear quicker than that.</p>
<p>Yes but that's causing a no reference because it's not expecting to be destroyed.</p>
<p>Is alive equals true and we say and is alive.</p>
<p>And then we set.</p>
<p>It's alive to false.</p>
<p>Beard.</p>
<p>For some reason that breaks me.</p>
<p>Getting rid of it quicker.</p>
<p>Get components rhymes.</p>
<p>Which we need unity ui for.</p>
<p>Enable = false.</p>
<p>And we'll just make it invisible.</p>
<p>If I do it the other way.</p>
<p>I can even make it a little bit quicker than I wanted to.</p>
<p>Ok some of the food is disappearing immediately and some of the food is.</p>
<p>Play oh my.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>It's inconsistent.</p>
<p>Why is the food staying there for a fucking month.</p>
<p>I already said if the object reaches its destination.</p>
<p>Wait for like basically a few friends and then.</p>
<p>Make the object invisible.</p>
<p>And if it's not reaching its destination.</p>
<p>Then why isn't reaching its destination.</p>
<p>And it's it's probably only a tiny fraction.</p>
<p>Ok so how do we fix this it's probably that it's probably that it's not exactly reaching its destination because it can be like an insanely small amount of floating points off.</p>
<p>So instead what we have to do is we have to calculate a distance.</p>
<p>Threshold and keep it within the distance threshold.</p>
<p>Ok fine.</p>
<p>Ok so what i'm going to do is.</p>
<p>My game manager because that's using debug we need to take debug out of the game manager.</p>
<p>Control.</p>
<p>Because what we need to know is what is that distance to threshold.</p>
<p>So essentially what i'm going to do is within this loop i'm going to say and it's kind of hard actually.</p>
<p>So we need a vector to store in.</p>
<p>And then we can.</p>
<p>Display that.</p>
<p>Two string.</p>
<p>I probably only want one of those dimensions to be completely.</p>
<p>That's linked now right.</p>
<p>So make a march.</p>
<p>It's landing at 00 will that's even weird.</p>
<p>So it's landing at 00 then why the fuck.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>See that one.</p>
<p>What the hell are you getting delivered at midnight you're all free.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't understand.</p>
<p>Because it is reaching 00.</p>
<p>Let's try something else.</p>
<p>If get distance is less than 0.0.</p>
<p>5f.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Wait for a tiny amount and then get rid of that.</p>
<p>Turn the image off.</p>
<p>Why is every it's like.</p>
<p>It's like hey there.</p>
<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>Umbrella warfare I guess.</p>
<p>Ok it's working now.</p>
<p>It's like hey there I want to I would like the number one to put on my screen it's like ok see that mount everest there that's on top of that giants fucking dick and he's like sat on top of that nuclear weapon and that nuclear weapons on the moon and the moon's in a different universe yeah just just stand on that and i'll give you a number one it's like I fucking all I want is the number one why is it this hard.</p>
<p>Bitch is we want to tell time on to.</p>
<p>Play her eating animation.</p>
<p>It's not an animation nights and animator.</p>
<p>As she receives the food which is like here we want to say an empire on play and see what it's called.</p>
<p>Come on eat.</p>
<p>Time in lowercase eats for capital e.</p>
<p>What's linked her.</p>
<p>She'll do something she'll do something right here we go.</p>
<p>That's why.</p>
<p>And also if we.</p>
<p>Well I would say stop but stops probably not a good idea I think if we tell her to play another animation first.</p>
<p>It's kind of weird right it's like if you if you try to turn something on in unity that's already on that it won't do anything.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's good to turn it off and then turn it on.</p>
<p>Seizure.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>So I guess we only want to do this once per food objects I would think.</p>
<p>It's kind of weird because we we wanted to do it once per.</p>
<p>Yeah probably.</p>
<p>And what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>Throw these.</p>
<p>As we remove an object from the list we want to set should eat to false I think.</p>
<p>No because we've got to wait for the object to finish.</p>
<p>So as we play the animation.</p>
<p>We want to we want to set should eat to false.</p>
<p>Here we want to see if distance becomes blah blah blah.</p>
<p>And then if should eat should he falls playtime on eat.</p>
<p>What does that want to be set up.</p>
<p>And I would say as.</p>
<p>As this list.</p>
<p>Is filled up again.</p>
<p>As as food begins as food first gets thrown she's able to eat but then as soon as she does the ones she can no longer eat until she gets new food thrown at essentially is what i'm trying to achieve.</p>
<p>Yes perfect.</p>
<p>Yes she does but she did it out of sync.</p>
<p>Instead she doesn't when we make the match so maybe resetting should eat there is not the way to do it.</p>
<p>Like it's working but it's just it's.</p>
<p>Well maybe it's because it's cuz she's still stuck on the animation I think so as we as we reset should eat to true.</p>
<p>I should just immediately tell it to play the.</p>
<p>Animation.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>I need to be fair she wouldn't normally get this mini matches at once.</p>
<p>How to tell because like I said when the board gets cleared.</p>
<p>Because sometimes because what will happen is when new food is generated and it drops down sometimes you know.</p>
<p>It will create a new march so then we trigger a second match automatically without the plate doing anything.</p>
<p>So that.</p>
<p>Will occur from time to.</p>
<p>I kinda need to make sure she behaves properly when that happens.</p>
<p>She saw the works.</p>
<p>It's like as soon as as soon as the objects get thrown she plays the eating animation which is.</p>
<p>This is a cursed project ever.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I think that is a good.</p>
<p>4 hours nearly I think that's good progress I do feel good about the progress we I did good today.</p>
<p>I did good today.</p>
<p>I fixed a lot of bugs.</p>
<p>Both controller and mouse is working goes foods is now working the boards like the ghost the ghostbusters clearing correctly.</p>
<p>I feel like we're ready for the next stage I just don't want to do it today.</p>
<p>And the next stages to.</p>
<p>Get new food drop it down drop down existing food generate new food at the top.</p>
<p>Look for any additional matches with the regenerated board.</p>
<p>And then we can return control of the player after that.</p>
<p>And then then the whole game is pretty much done unless I want to start introducing like you know special.</p>
<p>Squares or whatever the falcon you know but I don't know.</p>
<p>I think as soon as this is a playable.</p>
<p>Yeah it's.</p>
<p>This has been a right pain in the ass.</p>
<p>It's cool.</p>
<p>But it has been a giant pan in the ass.</p>
<p>Much more than I thought it would be.</p>
<p>Where I left snow brakes launcher open.</p>
<p>Now what it's like.</p>
<p>Start with snow break.</p>
<p>Yes yes.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you thank you at all.</p>
<p>Who is skank.</p>
<p>Stop it no you're old.</p>
<p>An old character.</p>
<p>I refuse.</p>
<p>I don't want this character though.</p>
<p>How many to 0.1% chance seriously what are the odds of are actually showing up.</p>
<p>Does march.</p>
<p>There's more chance the chat ebt won't attempt to gaslight me the next time I get a question we all know that.</p>
<p>That's a pretty much.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>Like me.</p>
<p>I have nothing to show for it which is what we wanted.</p>
<p>We've got almost full energy.</p>
<p>Lifting the fog.</p>
<p>That's new.</p>
<p>Can we buy one.</p>
<p>Oh good.</p>
<p>My personal files.</p>
<p>Actually you're not max constellation yet.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>How is that even possible.</p>
<p>I've been clicking your personal file.</p>
<p>Catch you can have some.</p>
<p>What's spare today.</p>
<p>Pregnant.</p>
<p>There's something for the baby.</p>
<p>More energy.</p>
<p>Yes stop trying to sell me stuff what is the yellow door.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Can you scream a meal.</p>
<p>Monster.</p>
<p>Taking manifestation and shut up.</p>
<p>Max hp 0.5% already needed that.</p>
<p>Attack that's more like it plus 0.5.</p>
<p>What do you get.</p>
<p>Hp what is the higher game.</p>
<p>And then wonder why I get defensive.</p>
<p>Test.</p>
<p>You turn a tricks again.</p>
<p>Ok well that was.</p>
<p>What's this new thing.</p>
<p>Lifting a fog.</p>
<p>The tempering mirror trial is a gauntlet of boss enemy challenges periodically organised by handel forces.</p>
<p>The tempering mirror trial consists of five stages each stage you must smashed lead your manifestations to take on buses.</p>
<p>Recorded whether.</p>
<p>Repeat the boss so get it done bitch.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Will he was all talking no trousers.</p>
<p>You get along well with the metro you've got no pants.</p>
<p>Arsenal trousers.</p>
<p>We got some gems.</p>
<p>What are the nicest is this tell us about the the play store shenanigans.</p>
<p>We got a hot fix optimised video.</p>
<p>Some adjectives weren't able to exit combat during battle settlement.</p>
<p>Stuck in battle forever.</p>
<p>Can I pick these up.</p>
<p>Box.</p>
<p>I got more energy.</p>
<p>I have to do this thing as well don't I did I get something for this yeah.</p>
<p>Is my maths.</p>
<p>Neural simulation that's what we need to do.</p>
<p>Yank.</p>
<p>Yink.</p>
<p>Going force all you can do I think isn't that.</p>
<p>How do I have 8 evaluation attempts is normally foreigner.</p>
<p>Sofa I don't know which team to use which enemies do you have a recommendation.</p>
<p>I think it should be better against this one because.</p>
<p>Has yellow armour that she can destroy.</p>
<p>So I don't know do we want to have any my fanny sucks you know she needs of things level and i've actually.</p>
<p>Train.</p>
<p>Frost damage.</p>
<p>That's not good.</p>
<p>Auxiliary units.</p>
<p>Electrical damage what is she physical isn't she I think fanny is.</p>
<p>Kinetic.</p>
<p>Bring out your.</p>
<p>Who else is good with.</p>
<p>Catch you maybe.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Let's go let's go.</p>
<p>Haha lost your gun.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>Get him.</p>
<p>Get some health back.</p>
<p>How are you so annoying.</p>
<p>Can you pause on the face.</p>
<p>Will you ever reload your weapon.</p>
<p>Where is he.</p>
<p>Where how did it turn it away till I had catcher.</p>
<p>He's so annoying.</p>
<p>Watch it.</p>
<p>I swear to god you stupid stupid man I forgot that if you won unit dies you fail instantly it's so stupid.</p>
<p>Does that count as a clear though.</p>
<p>So why would it say clear timer if I didn't clear it it's weird.</p>
<p>Is it supposed to be a strap for this a lot.</p>
<p>Are you do is reload.</p>
<p>Reloads on youtube.</p>
<p>I need a very strong word.</p>
<p>Take ad.</p>
<p>Joseph harden without.</p>
<p>Can I sweep that now.</p>
<p>Evaluation attempts.</p>
<p>Did the dinosaurs expect you to do that manually every single time today.</p>
<p>We're going to need healer.</p>
<p>If we take.</p>
<p>Old school life.</p>
<p>New school life.</p>
<p>And we'll take old school healer.</p>
<p>I think cuz I want to need some kind of healer.</p>
<p>How did I lose the energy though.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Where's my timer at.</p>
<p>Set alarm.</p>
<p>Did it reset or something.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did we set it.</p>
<p>Is it the same map.</p>
<p>Where I didn't reset an entirely.</p>
<p>I think the trial reset or something.</p>
<p>I have to delete them first on a.</p>
<p>To get the tokens.</p>
<p>I need more blue.</p>
<p>My blue.</p>
<p>More blue.</p>
<p>And is it the same map.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Get him then.</p>
<p>So what reset.</p>
<p>Can I call you fat robot.</p>
<p>Did the thingies reset the.</p>
<p>The presents that you can shoot and stuff like that.</p>
<p>How's it literally just the time trials.</p>
<p>How do you get blue.</p>
<p>Wasn't blue down by the dock or whatever.</p>
<p>I love it spawns the robots on your head so you can't move.</p>
<p>I got a blue.</p>
<p>He's already dead.</p>
<p>Stop spawning in my.</p>
<p>Camera you fool.</p>
<p>You damn fool.</p>
<p>Steel ball.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I have to go this way get out of my way.</p>
<p>Put on mighty.</p>
<p>Example of a game.</p>
<p>Game getting in the way of itself.</p>
<p>Caveman.</p>
<p>How could you be homeless if you a caveman.</p>
<p>Did they run out of caves maybe.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>It's like the hitbox for the interaction is like really.</p>
<p>Finicky.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this.</p>
<p>I wish I knew.</p>
<p>I don't know but i'm going to stop in a minute.</p>
<p>Why I asked myself that why don't why don't make the goddamn things even worse.</p>
<p>Call luke.</p>
<p>I look this they show you.</p>
<p>They show you.</p>
<p>The actually show you the progress you've made now.</p>
<p>I think so so if I go east.</p>
<p>This should be another enemy yeah and I can even see it on the menu.</p>
<p>Which is a massive improvement that makes a huge difference I don't know.</p>
<p>So why the hell they didn't have it whatever ok yeah that's a that's a much needed improvement.</p>
<p>Is now we can actually see where the hell were missing them and stuff which is good.</p>
<p>But he wasn't on the map.</p>
<p>I don't think sometimes you can also get ones that are not on the map so maybe they have two types maybe they have like ones that only spawn once a day which are the yellow dots.</p>
<p>You know like session spawns or whatever.</p>
<p>The one before.</p>
<p>He was on the map.</p>
<p>Maybe he's undocumented.</p>
<p>What why am I still doing this right let's just leave just leave right now otherwise you're going to be in your all day you know it.</p>
<p>What unit list what else did they change.</p>
<p>Are you can search by unit now so if you want something so if I just want the blue guys now all they need to do right is let me select only the blues right let me select multiple of these.</p>
<p>Let me actually select all the blue guys.</p>
<p>And then I can just go around farming blue guys right.</p>
<p>I mean we do need blue guys goes off for.</p>
<p>So I guess you've got a.</p>
<p>You've got a flag one.</p>
<p>Which is seems a little.</p>
<p>Yeah I was ok that doesn't work the way I thought it did I thought you could just fill them and then you know.</p>
<p>Go back to the game and it would only show those filtered ones but you can only fill them temporarily in the map and then they all come back on.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Like the polygon count.</p>
<p>Raise ok.</p>
<p>So where is he then he's already.</p>
<p>So let's put this into action now let's actually kill all the blue guys.</p>
<p>Get it.</p>
<p>He's over here there is.</p>
<p>Rise and then go back to my map.</p>
<p>And adjust my.</p>
<p>How do I bring up unit list.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Our next blue guy of this type is over here.</p>
<p>8 types.</p>
<p>Essentially you doing 8 round trips when you could have done it in one.</p>
<p>So it's still.</p>
<p>Be a lot better to be honest.</p>
<p>I think they should have just put checkboxes next to them.</p>
<p>And then you can take them on and off.</p>
<p>And then you just go back into the game and then that's it.</p>
<p>It'll show you whatever's.</p>
<p>Is the only the only down.</p>
<p>Whether I can think of is some people going to be so stupid.</p>
<p>Is there going to be like.</p>
<p>You have to manually turn it on.</p>
<p>When you get stuck for one day at mast.</p>
<p>I mean genshin managers at ray kenshin makes the game so easy that like zepla can play.</p>
<p>But it's also like really like it's good and it's well telegraphed and everything else so I think they've found a good balance.</p>
<p>And also the problem with this right is you going you're doing 8 round trips to get to the blue guys by the time you've done your 8 round trips i've killed more none blue guys because they happen to be in my way on the way there.</p>
<p>Right then I have blue guys.</p>
<p>Which makes me think that essentially.</p>
<p>Fix the hall filter thing.</p>
<p>Because if you desperate for blue guys and you do 8 round trips killing blue guys and you're killing things on the way which you probably will.</p>
<p>So how much time is it reserving you if I should probably it's probably taking you longer because you're not just.</p>
<p>You're not doing them in order you're not.</p>
<p>Not doing them geographically you do and i'm like.</p>
<p>I have a checkbox next to each one of these right and all you would do is you would just as you click them the checkboxes go on if you click them again the checkbox has got off so you can have like multiple things selected and also since most people are going to be after a certain colour while you're at it just have select you know all orange all red or purple as well so people can like just.</p>
<p>And that would actually be like.</p>
<p>Beautiful what a beautiful.</p>
<p>That would be but instead you see what happens as soon as you go back everything comes back on again.</p>
<p>You've got to leave a flag and by the time you get to the fucking flag.</p>
<p>Get out my way this needs to change as well I literally cannot get past my own fucking robots.</p>
<p>I mean how many blues do they have.</p>
<p>123456 78 I was under exaggerating 9:10 11 12 you would have to do 12 round trips.</p>
<p>The words currently set up because the 12 blue types of enemies.</p>
<p>Which is just silly.</p>
<p>Yeah it would significantly reduce the amount of backtracking that you'd have to do.</p>
<p>Yes I thought I wanted to farm all the blue enemies but I don't know.</p>
<p>It's gonna be disconnected too long i'm only on that was only enemy type number 2 of 12 do I really want to do that 10 more times not really.</p>
<p>Yeah cuz it's again it's like thinking in multiple dimensions right I don't know why why do they struggle with this stuff like i'm a hobby tonight.</p>
<p>Is the weatherman today is great if you or if you want one specific type of enemy if you're like oh you know what.</p>
<p>These blue adventists.</p>
<p>Nothing gets nothing gets.</p>
<p>Sound like a blue adventist in my party.</p>
<p>Put my assumption is that most people are playing the game that we're.</p>
<p>I think I think that's more of an educare is right again and this is what I always said don't design your camera on edge cases that's an edge case.</p>
<p>Can they eat blue tickets.</p>
<p>And the current filter is kind of makes that 12 times more.</p>
<p>It's true or extra credits said in one of their videos actually that you.</p>
<p>You can learn more from bad games.</p>
<p>But you play them and it becomes kind of obvious where it's failing and you're like ah ok well clearly that shouldn't be like that.</p>
<p>And you said you can sort of learn.</p>
<p>Wait what.</p>
<p>Please give green tickets.</p>
<p>Wait what.</p>
<p>No no i'm really glad I didn't do 12 round trips that wasn't even what I needed the blue how does that make sense either the blues give green tickets.</p>
<p>Who works at this company.</p>
<p>Who are you sure yourself.</p>
<p>Why would that make any sense.</p>
<p>So what gives the blue then.</p>
<p>Purple gives blue.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Can we didn't even get what we need in the end.</p>
<p>We need to kill the purples.</p>
<p>How many purples are there then.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Who designs these things.</p>
<p>Let's see we have three colours of enemies.</p>
<p>Purple and blue.</p>
<p>We have different coloured tickets blue purple and gold what colour tickets should the blue enemies drop.</p>
<p>And someone's like green.</p>
<p>Excellent idea yes.</p>
<p>That will upset.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>Scatter around so there are one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 round trips would need to do if you want blue tickets will I suppose that's better than 12.</p>
<p>Jesus christ.</p>
<p>I just I who works at these companies.</p>
<p>Cleaning lady probably would have made the blue enemies drop blue tickets.</p>
<p>This is far deeper than that.</p>
<p>This is some like this is some kind of sickness.</p>
<p>Within the company.</p>
<p>It's some kind of deep political corruption gold you told me was anna that must have been the guy on the way.</p>
<p>Death.</p>
<p>How do I get up there.</p>
<p>Good night this way.</p>
<p>This guy is meant to be purple.</p>
<p>Argos purley was.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>And there was one more of these no there's two more of these guys one over here.</p>
<p>This is like that marquee that I downloaded on github once that scrolled from left to right.</p>
<p>This is for players who failed torture isn't quite high enough they want to dial it up a bit.</p>
<p>The plaza saigon you know this isn't quite enough pain and suffering for me.</p>
<p>Can I get a bit more spicy than that.</p>
<p>How can i.</p>
<p>How can I suffer more.</p>
<p>Do lots of clicking run from one under the fucking map to the other 10 times over.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Did they fix it can you get on the tower fantasy now.</p>
<p>Was it just a temporary.</p>
<p>No no no no.</p>
<p>It is still blocked off I just again it's like I don't understand like who.</p>
<p>Make these decisions.</p>
<p>Players really want in an open world exploration game I know massive barriers blocking you off from the most important landmark in the city.</p>
<p>Yes do it now.</p>
<p>It's too stupid to be real.</p>
<p>Are you flung me off the cliff.</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>I remember very well I just knocked me off the cliff I can't.</p>
<p>It's there it's just.</p>
<p>Yeah but i'm testing it's new systems you see.</p>
<p>So I can.</p>
<p>Give my constructive feedback that no one will listen now.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>How do I even get back to him at this point oh we got new gifts.</p>
<p>I got where to excited then like this.</p>
<p>See what I mean like even this is somehow better than wuthering waves.</p>
<p>I know right.</p>
<p>Symphony.</p>
<p>My flag go where did he go.</p>
<p>He came back to life what the hell.</p>
<p>I think this guy's purple.</p>
<p>Yes argos that was one of 10.</p>
<p>That was only one type of 10 I think that's all of them.</p>
<p>How can we missed one.</p>
<p>There's no way I killed him.</p>
<p>Where are we.</p>
<p>What's really sad news now good luck with that cos i'm going to be looking for robots for a while so you know good luck with that.</p>
<p>Good good luck with your devastated national.</p>
<p>I got purple robots to farm.</p>
<p>Ok well apparently there's another one.</p>
<p>Move off exactly cuz like you know you can have freaking.</p>
<p>She's 18 is she oh yeah it's fine then.</p>
<p>So like what what is this image exactly is apparently this is fine so I just curious.</p>
<p>Good lord.</p>
<p>You said it.</p>
<p>I really need to stop for my own mental health I think.</p>
<p>What is an old lady comes to swear.</p>
<p>Ok get him.</p>
<p>Yeah they did say they were going to compensate players but.</p>
<p>Will there compensate none.</p>
<p>These are levels i'll leave these levels.</p>
<p>Tickets.</p>
<p>All this to level up some stupid robot there we go.</p>
<p>Forehead flick.</p>
<p>Is max level.</p>
<p>Is max level activist chan is now max level.</p>
<p>And we can do one of these as well we can do justice warrior now let's do one of the others because we'll do shitbot.</p>
<p>Otherwise I feel like it's too much of the other you know.</p>
<p>How well we do.</p>
<p>Time trial let's do it.</p>
<p>I saw you slot.</p>
<p>Lock.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll be too much because you have a limit on you.</p>
<p>The cost is too high yeah I can only I can only afford up to 50 though and I yeah I don't have the allowance stop it ok so we do we do have a new slot but i'm out of.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know I think it worse than this they're about the same now at me because this game's got really heavy on fun service.</p>
<p>Does catchy do stuff.</p>
<p>I feel like she helps.</p>
<p>Which helps.</p>
<p>I can't see anything for the flames is literally all I can see is flames.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>I can't see anything.</p>
<p>Get away from me your feelings.</p>
<p>Make so much money.</p>
<p>I've recent.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>What's favouritism.</p>
<p>What I was found with these google sensor things it's always something really stupid like you always think it's going to be really lewd already dodgy and then you look at it and it's like.</p>
<p>Ok all my guys are still alive and healthy barely.</p>
<p>Work to 160.</p>
<p>182.</p>
<p>Youtube cover it later.</p>
<p>I keep my eyes peeled.</p>
<p>I'm curious.</p>
<p>It's not listening really stupid.</p>
<p>Somebody's always just probably at all.</p>
<p>100.</p>
<p>294.</p>
<p>194.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>It's because android fans most likely so annoyed I don't know I feel like it's more like the gonna be google I would imagine.</p>
<p>Because google are quite progressive and.</p>
<p>Activist there's only very sensor cos I remember I used to play like someone cargo and stuff games like that and that studio like shut down the guy.</p>
<p>Designer of that franchise literally retired over sonny's over censorship and stuff of it.</p>
<p>Samurai golden stuff.</p>
<p>You're too bad.</p>
<p>How do I find out what my leaderboard.</p>
<p>I want to top 20% apparently.</p>
<p>27.9.</p>
<p>I could do better.</p>
<p>The last of us and like the more realism ones.</p>
<p>I can understand if it's like overly like you know lolly stuff or whatever.</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>I don't get a.</p>
<p>Material farming stories done i've got jordan's funnel but i'll probably wait till.</p>
<p>Will do it before genshin comes out.</p>
<p>How old is kenshin got like 445.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know I know they try to avoid that but I don't know what the reason is because back in the day they were worried about like stars wouldn't stork like adult games and stuff like that and you know they were worried about who they could sell it to.</p>
<p>It would significantly reduce like the market in the audience and stuff but now everything's online it's like I don't know people do seem to still want to avoid the adult age rating.</p>
<p>Mama sure why.</p>
<p>I don't know maybe it's just like the stigma that comes with or whatever.</p>
<p>I don't feel like it would hinder I think that's the issue though I think doesn't play store and ios.</p>
<p>I need to have a limit all day I don't think they would actually host adult games if they had an adult reading I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Anything that's too sexualised or adult or anything like that so maybe that's the reason why they don't.</p>
<p>Yeah I think it is now that I think about it.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I think that's better.</p>
<p>It's a raining.</p>
<p>In the watering.</p>
<p>What's the weather in spare.</p>
<p>What is.</p>
<p>Waving battlefield.</p>
<p>Do i.</p>
<p>News now let me.</p>
<p>Which one am I supposed to do.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>So many times.</p>
<p>So can you use trial characters.</p>
<p>Oh my god none of my characters are available.</p>
<p>Yes yes they are.</p>
<p>I don't even know that is.</p>
<p>Yeah if it's a dude then I skip.</p>
<p>If it's the new girl with the glasses i'm skipping as well.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for.</p>
<p>Shark keeper or whatever she's called tequila.</p>
<p>Isn't the little the little version of her like a four-star or something so i'll probably end up getting her as well and then I can have a team of children i'll be funny.</p>
<p>Is it too bad as aware.</p>
<p>Well I wear I need another healer to be honest more than I need another dbs.</p>
<p>Echo skill cooldown don't really care.</p>
<p>Increased resonance skill what do you want.</p>
<p>Now what.</p>
<p>Just get on with it.</p>
<p>Successful dodge restores let's just do basic attack.</p>
<p>Upgrade.</p>
<p>Tequila.</p>
<p>Just a pussycat.</p>
<p>Icast.</p>
<p>Speaking of cats a resident skill moderately.</p>
<p>Good morning increased damage.</p>
<p>Vereena what have you got for me.</p>
<p>I shouldn't floral scent.</p>
<p>Yes please.</p>
<p>I'm not that he hit me once but.</p>
<p>How do I get to cocky.</p>
<p>Residence damage slightly increased energy required to cost resonance reduced yeah let's do that.</p>
<p>Energy costs down.</p>
<p>Can you feel it feel what.</p>
<p>The overabundance of subtitles I do I do.</p>
<p>Ok this is this is very panic on me do you not think this is very panna karting.</p>
<p>In a dream scab.</p>
<p>But I feel like they have kind of copied.</p>
<p>The heel comes after I saw that one.</p>
<p>Sing the wrong way.</p>
<p>Amazon turned around resonance alliteration damage increased going in.</p>
<p>Because I see a lot of echo cool down reduced but I feel like the echo doesn't really do that much like the echo has got to be a.</p>
<p>Minimal amount of your damage.</p>
<p>Play floaty.</p>
<p>Is marina not doing anything.</p>
<p>Ask does she have to like charge up.</p>
<p>Where's the charger.</p>
<p>Add two cats and a woman extra crates let's go.</p>
<p>Cool down an energy required for liberation it's called it's probably good after defeating a certain number of enemies with this basic attack someone occasional judgement strikes will we play judge judy so make sense to me it seems a bit loud to me.</p>
<p>Healing complaints.</p>
<p>Thank god resin skill damage slightly increased.</p>
<p>What do we buying.</p>
<p>What is book.</p>
<p>Alright i'll see you later thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>Enjoy your shopping.</p>
<p>Too much stars.</p>
<p>Make me sound like ma.</p>
<p>You did already.</p>
<p>He dead already.</p>
<p>Skip this.</p>
<p>And leave.</p>
<p>That's it the whole thing was done and dusted.</p>
<p>Already.</p>
<p>I will take those.</p>
<p>I will buy those.</p>
<p>Do I need any of these maybe.</p>
<p>What is this investigation.</p>
<p>Some echo boxes or whatever the hell.</p>
<p>Level node.</p>
<p>What we can do for now.</p>
<p>What's a bit repetitive.</p>
<p>Look up plenty of time I guess.</p>
<p>Should we mix it up let's use new girl.</p>
<p>So first time for everything.</p>
<p>Additional damage let's go.</p>
<p>And what have you got for me.</p>
<p>I have 10:00 to voltage after casting resin skill and heavy attack obtained electro strike up to casting thundering methods.</p>
<p>Skill damage and reduces its cooldown magic I wasn't able to get verena on the last one I don't know if she hadn't charged.</p>
<p>China shop.</p>
<p>2:40.</p>
<p>Is max himself dizzy in falls over.</p>
<p>Compared to me of the units I think it's because she's only got a 4-star weapon.</p>
<p>Where's all my other units of a 5 star 11 maybe that's it.</p>
<p>Why are you up here.</p>
<p>Skip up 10 verena of 300 dream fragments.</p>
<p>Do you want a healer.</p>
<p>I can't leave so we don't go that way.</p>
<p>Which is even more confusing why she was up there in the first place I don't know.</p>
<p>All rights increases for successful dodgers.</p>
<p>Let's do the energy region.</p>
<p>Because it's got it online.</p>
<p>I'm not always doing successful dodgers.</p>
<p>I'm being honest.</p>
<p>What do you want.</p>
<p>Metal gear.</p>
<p>Lose 40% of your hp and gain 300 dream fragments and just give me the fragments.</p>
<p>Just give me the fragments I don't want one of these.</p>
<p>Risk reward things.</p>
<p>I can't see.</p>
<p>I cannot sue.</p>
<p>All right well.</p>
<p>Energy.</p>
<p>Skill and liberation residents liberation slightly reduced for each basic attack.</p>
<p>The both similar right they both give energy back and sounds a little bit better than the other one.</p>
<p>After defeating a certain number of enemies resin skill casting resin skills summons hypercube so kind of want to see what that is.</p>
<p>Hypercubes.</p>
<p>Cool down a present school reduced shield gained when attacked risen skill damage moderately increased let's just do more damage.</p>
<p>Do you want the bell that's on your shield doesn't do my damage.</p>
<p>I don't understand hp.</p>
<p>Damage the target yes more damage increase more damage let's go.</p>
<p>That is what we want and we can summon.</p>
<p>Do we get an additional support we don't lose vereena right.</p>
<p>You know what also is on cars friend.</p>
<p>So let's go let's go with monster features because he's on cars friend.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>All right let's go.</p>
<p>At 10.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>And basic attack increase sounds good to me.</p>
<p>Fear struggle let's go.</p>
<p>Who's the cage the bird bitches.</p>
<p>His voice is like goofy than I expected.</p>
<p>Metaphor of 103 glacier I just reduce the cooldown of resin skill.</p>
<p>Challenge completely none of this really feels like a challenge though.</p>
<p>Even saw.</p>
<p>Resonance liberation damage increase.</p>
<p>Mystery dreamland.</p>
<p>Cool down required liberation reduced.</p>
<p>Critics.</p>
<p>And damage increase sounds all good to me.</p>
<p>What have you got.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Onwards.</p>
<p>Play spotify.</p>
<p>Successful dodge.</p>
<p>Liberation damage increased by 60% I will take that good sir glad I save some extra currency now.</p>
<p>It feels like all you do is flap around like what do they call it you know morris dancing where they have like big you feel like you're just a morris dancer rather than a fighter.</p>
<p>Speed.</p>
<p>It can get fast in places but I think it because it's still floaty when it's faster just doesn't.</p>
<p>Feel right to me it feels.</p>
<p>Fast and floaty.</p>
<p>The money.</p>
<p>Spend dream fragments to reset metaphors once increase crit rate let's go.</p>
<p>I'll do the other two tomorrow or something.</p>
<p>I think we did.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what I might do then is.</p>
<p>What to do and it is a signature weapon.</p>
<p>How do I oh my god this fucking in the first how do I go down to the material.</p>
<p>Press r3 like I normally do and it takes me the money I press l3 it doesn't do anything I got down it goes to there.</p>
<p>It's inconsistent between.</p>
<p>Let's get some more of those.</p>
<p>How many attempts that took me just to get to the fucking I needed some farm.</p>
<p>Get this web and ascended.</p>
<p>Why we need one goals.</p>
<p>I don't know how many of the lower level mocks we've got.</p>
<p>That's probably enough and I don't want to over farm so let's go back to our synthesiser and see.</p>
<p>Play fast everything we need.</p>
<p>If we need to find some more.</p>
<p>I still telling me to clear carnival we'll do that.</p>
<p>Quest specifically telling me to do it.</p>
<p>Yeah that should be enough I think.</p>
<p>Do we have the funds is.</p>
<p>I would expect.</p>
<p>The ones to actually have the money.</p>
<p>So her weapon is 90 already.</p>
<p>And how far can we get it.</p>
<p>81.</p>
<p>89 but we run out of money.</p>
<p>So we need some more money.</p>
<p>I do believe we get a little bit three grand.</p>
<p>Let's get done I guess so that we can.</p>
<p>Add it to the fonts.</p>
<p>But it is but a splash in the ocean.</p>
<p>On car can't do any damage.</p>
<p>I didn't see him hiding in the bush.</p>
<p>You little bitch.</p>
<p>That seems to be the daily quest.</p>
<p>And that is delis.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Can we have some money please mr battle pass.</p>
<p>Spin the way flights absorb the echoes.</p>
<p>Do we even get money off the battle pass next no you don't.</p>
<p>There is a polar at level 20.</p>
<p>Ok let me farm some money.</p>
<p>Did I mean I may be able to get some more money out of the events but I just don't know if I can be.</p>
<p>So tired I actually I think I checked as well I don't even think this money I can get from the event.</p>
<p>Shell credit.</p>
<p>At 40 energy each wow.</p>
<p>Ok I give me 82 grams.</p>
<p>How are some paying attention to how much we needed.</p>
<p>We need 323 grand we have 160 so we have half the money we need.</p>
<p>What a joke.</p>
<p>You need money yes I know.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>So what I need 320 g.</p>
<p>Was that total amount I was that.</p>

<p>It is because archaeologist said hi.</p>
<p>In the events rewards.</p>
<p>Should I just do it then.</p>
<p>Will I need to I need to spend energy anywhere so I guess i'll just farm some.</p>

<p>Struggle and see the challenge.</p>
<p>Resonance liberation damage increase.</p>
<p>Alright this is so this game is so dumb.</p>
<p>D how do you say I got a day and get fucking head I got a d and I never got hit ones.</p>
<p>Ok radio.</p>
<p>Is it supposed to struggle more.</p>
<p>My father said luke.</p>
<p>Join the dark side.</p>
<p>Stop breathing heavily on me.</p>
<p>And where is princess leia.</p>
<p>Where princess that would make princess leia my sister would not.</p>

<p>Before I knew it was a sister or something energy increased echo skill cooldown reduced when cassettes casting.</p>
<p>Best on the current dream scab.</p>
<p>What's the weather now.</p>
<p>I live in a fair world you'd have to leave the planet.</p>
<p>Raise.</p>
<p>So he's not wrong but also like what can you do about it.</p>
<p>I think it's terrible.</p>
<p>What I think it's worth.</p>
<p>The impatience and all the tricks they play on you.</p>
<p>The politicians don't want to do a damn thing about it.</p>
<p>But yeah it's a little more complicated than just.</p>
<p>At the same time you know kids with no money can have.</p>
<p>4 years worth of top quality entertainment from a product that costs that's had a billion dollar spent on it at this point completely for free which is actually astronomical so it's like you can either get the most amazing value ever which is everything for nothing you know or you can blow your entire bank account on it and you know get very little extra and return.</p>
<p>So there are different two sides to a I mean genshin could never have been the game that it became without it being a gacha game couldn't be the game that it is today if it was just a normal triple a game 900 million years.</p>
<p>The model has made the game possible.</p>
<p>Not so black and white.</p>

<p>Gambling addicts.</p>
<p>Turn on screw me over.</p>
<p>My amazing drawing.</p>
<p>Game appears to be muted.</p>
<p>When's it going to notice.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Buying neil is outfit.</p>
<p>It depends if I win the 50/50 and I considerate how long is left on the discount door because it's for the it won't be discounted them all that.</p>
<p>I get i'm pressing the wrong buttons.</p>
<p>I got 300 on me right now.</p>
<p>2 days you going to make me decide in 2 days screw that i'm about it then.</p>
<p>How do I buy things under pressure.</p>
<p>4 days.</p>
<p>Stop the alarm.</p>
<p>Can you guess don't probably let you come that one.</p>
<p>Was inazuma.</p>
<p>Before reaching in the story or whatever.</p>
<p>I don't know cuz they have these new they have these like.</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>I don't know i've been playing against instead once I don't know how it's different for new players now as it is so it's hard for me though.</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>I need my own experience to draw from.</p>
<p>I'm not here.</p>
<p>Because the question in the live stream was how a players going to level their characters.</p>
<p>If they can't get to sad place so I doubt it it's probably just going to let you physically go there.</p>
<p>I don't understand well.</p>
<p>When the game first came out you could just.</p>
<p>My brand new account I think you could go all the way over here if you want it now.</p>
<p>But now and i've noticed since starting a new account more recently.</p>
<p>Unlock region by region now.</p>
<p>Yes I don't know how that works for because I haven't played an account enough to know I don't know whether that affects.</p>
<p>Follow the footprints.</p>
<p>Can be the closest one.</p>
<p>Yes I don't even know why they would need to let you skip anything.</p>
<p>You already have world level which changes the difficult.</p>
<p>In the first place that needed fixing.</p>
<p>Is there any issue within azuma.</p>
<p>Where a commissions now split between that's awesome.</p>
<p>So now they can be spread across regions that's actually really good.</p>
<p>Say hi to dangerous.</p>
<p>I don't know if.</p>
<p>Levels go maybe inazuma has a minimum wool level or something I don't know.</p>
<p>Because the only time highly dangerous and that wasn't in the game originally the other dad at some point.</p>
<p>The newer interface of highly dangerous only applies if the enemies are higher level in you.</p>
<p>So if it was saying that it must mean that the region has like a minimum level or something maybe that's what they're talking about I have no I don't know I have no idea I don't know like I said once I played it as it's been coming outside no idea.</p>
<p>How far is the castle on the 2nd account.</p>
<p>And even then I didn't like I just I don't know why anybody would want to play any other way to be honest I don't know why anybody would want to play I guess if you get a new character and you worried about getting levelling mats as soon as I can think of.</p>
<p>Used to be not anymore.</p>
<p>When for any came out they lifted it.</p>
<p>If you clicked if you clicked under the map and you tried to walk to in a in a zoomer it would teleport you out but they remove that when free account cuz she can walk on water.</p>
<p>And you couldn't take a you couldn't take a wave rider from in a zoomer to leeway before but you come now.</p>
<p>Where's that one.</p>
<p>Is kind of interesting having commissions.</p>
<p>Why isn't that count as.</p>
<p>You can now.</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p>You couldn't previously sell out of inazuma.</p>
<p>Inazuma.</p>
<p>Should we let them.</p>
<p>Yeah but what's.</p>
<p>What what am I looking at.</p>
<p>Weather in leeway now I know I told you that.</p>
<p>Right so I did commissions.</p>
<p>Condenser resin I guess.</p>
<p>Well the only way you could do before.</p>
<p>Right I don't want to rewards.</p>
<p>Why are you.</p>
<p>Am I a misunderstood what you said I thought you said when I started I started on a year.</p>
<p>Trolling teapot salesman does he have any.</p>
<p>Why does he want to talk to me by the way.</p>
<p>What have you got to say to me you freak.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Does he have any new spin crystals that I don't have.</p>
<p>Start over here maybe.</p>
<p>I got him when I was getting carrara constellations or something.</p>
<p>I see it.</p>
<p>How do you gliding with new players get it for free.</p>
<p>I am carrara.</p>
<p>Probably because she's been replaced essentially by drill girl so she was the best.</p>
<p>How the hell did I miss that.</p>
<p>Which is good but I don't know.</p>
<p>I mean it's showing up to walk across probably.</p>
<p>Ok what do I do.</p>
<p>How does one get this chest.</p>
<p>Was there before.</p>
<p>Stop casting me.</p>
<p>It might be this here but it seems far away from the original chest.</p>
<p>Well that's a different chest.</p>
<p>So how the hell do I open this chest.</p>
<p>No long.</p>
<p>Not long at all.</p>
<p>What's going on what's going on.</p>
<p>Somebody in the cage.</p>
<p>Has nobody in this cage.</p>
<p>Wheelbarrow with nothing in it.</p>
<p>Cage with nothing in it carriage with nothing in it.</p>
<p>I didn't get to see what it said.</p>
<p>What is the.</p>
<p>I just might screw the assistant actually.</p>
<p>Get the goods.</p>
<p>3 days what from the special program what are you on about.</p>
<p>That's like saying in 1980 it was 15 years 7 months.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So we got another chest.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I think you can spend.</p>
<p>Is it 10 in this movie is 20 is the minimum.</p>
<p>I remember.</p>
<p>It's my take a while.</p>
<p>Miss me.</p>

<p>So where was the cave.</p>
<p>I'm completely lost now.</p>
<p>Play the ones now.</p>
<p>I need to find that chest.</p>
<p>Say came from i've gotten turned around here.</p>
<p>I came from a beach.</p>
<p>Up through a cave I unlock the second chest but I got kind of lost.</p>
<p>And there was a cage wasn't a.</p>
<p>Are they don't see the kids anymore that's weird.</p>
<p>It's over here.</p>
<p>Why the hell is this game so dark right now.</p>
<p>I've got no stamina.</p>
<p>Does my hydra.</p>
<p>Hydro overload.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Death by hydro overdose.</p>

<p>Oceans of the changing wall.</p>
<p>Received them also get woo the 7th to roll the wine barrel in the cave.</p>
<p>Process appears to have been forcibly interrupted.</p>
<p>And actually.</p>
<p>Make I found where this goes.</p>
<p>Is a treasure chest opened up for me.</p>
<p>When.</p>
<p>My favourite character.</p>
<p>Is the stick man that was loaded that was loaded as the game was being built.</p>
<p>He was called stickman test 01b.</p>
<p>He's my favourite character.</p>
<p>You had no arms or legs.</p>
<p>How many one I he couldn't speak.</p>
<p>He just spun around in a circle.</p>
<p>And scream the high pitch noise.</p>
<p>Ok maybe I open the chest maybe the chest.</p>
<p>Was the other chest.</p>
<p>The one that we just picked up it could it could be.</p>
<p>Who also does one of those.</p>
<p>From the jump.</p>

<p>That's the cage.</p>
<p>There's the statue.</p>
<p>Let me go all the way up here.</p>
<p>Why do I never have any stamina.</p>

<p>Exploration right now.</p>
<p>93 of light laxative 97 of southern fried chicken mountain.</p>

<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>What did you see all that what the hell.</p>
<p>That was one.</p>
<p>Big ass hole.</p>
<p>If my wife would be jealous of that one.</p>
<p>Angie speak.</p>
<p>Explain yourself.</p>
<p>Do you customise your look like travels.</p>
<p>Have you absolutely beats are you looking for a place to put up your feet and enjoy a cup of tea.</p>
<p>That sounds actually.</p>
<p>Dancing.</p>
<p>Brown sludge you have tea just so in fact this is the only tea stall for miles around.</p>
<p>What teams do you have.</p>
<p>Explore fairy explosive sweet nectar tears that's the one.</p>
<p>It's a special type of.</p>
<p>Play made from wild sweet flowers and the nectar whopper flowers.</p>
<p>Exhaustion you won't find it anywhere else.</p>
<p>Are you saying as much as the others like she's like.</p>
<p>Bullied.</p>
<p>Shut off and it sounds amazing too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately yours has run out of necessary ingredients unfortunately there are some close by but unfortunately it's a big dangerous since you've got a pick sweet flowers while dealing with pyro rubber flowers that's just pops out of nowhere.</p>
<p>As long as I don't get enough ingredients to reopen who cares how big the reward I offer is i'll make it all back and then some is a shame embarrassing to boot but would you mind just hanging around for a bit i'm going to pass it on off to adventures guild and get them to help harvest the materials.</p>
<p>Do we not find this a little bit of manipulative a little bit of a winky dink.</p>
<p>Good news where the adventures you're looking for.</p>
<p>Explosive sweet neck to tea just leave the ingredients to us.</p>
<p>Drawings of mount minion add caution against taking.</p>
<p>Oh my god we shut up.</p>
<p>Good choice.</p>
<p>Please be called a whopper flower mountain.</p>
<p>Oh I just remembered I actually already have a contractual agreement with the adventurers guild if I simply allow the two of you to just take over it wouldn't be proper.</p>
<p>You're weird you know that here you've got.</p>
<p>Do hope you will be back dear.</p>
<p>You just want what's in this chest.</p>

<p>Where is the torch.</p>
<p>Can you remember where the torch was.</p>
<p>Which direction do I wanna be in.</p>
<p>I know we zipped up the cliff I know that much.</p>
<p>But I don't know from which side.</p>
<p>Find the torch and done for.</p>
<p>See if we can find the torch that needed lighting.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing it.</p>
<p>What is it 1.0.</p>
<p>Ask him about that one.</p>
<p>Ok I don't know where the torches.</p>
<p>Where's the torch.</p>
<p>Noodle.</p>

<p>Noodle on.</p>
<p>You learn.</p>
<p>Ok let's see.</p>
<p>We need this one.</p>
<p>That's probably not how I meant to do that ok.</p>
<p>Radio on.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I see it now I see it.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>An alarm.</p>
<p>Little on.</p>
<p>Do you want a clone.</p>
<p>Why am I so bad at this.</p>
<p>It's impossible it's actually impossible.</p>
<p>Can I put it back there put it back in there ok.</p>
<p>Now get up there.</p>
<p>Method to the madness.</p>
<p>Give me that.</p>
<p>I don't know how i'm supposed to do this.</p>
<p>I guess and then do this and then quickly quickly quickly.</p>
<p>How do I do these two.</p>
<p>Do this when I could do this.</p>
<p>Can zip it back.</p>
<p>Then suck that up stick it in there zoom over there and then boom.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That was tricky that was that was a bit tricky that on.</p>
<p>I don't know where that torch went.</p>
<p>Is that chest down there.</p>
<p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>Will the owl I mean he is now.</p>
<p>Can you send the same question 42 times at this point.</p>
<p>Pc boo what date team would you play on a wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>You're insane you know.</p>
<p>You still wants me to leave he's up to now got him.</p>
<p>Oh yeah okay so this is this is originally where I went because I saw this and I was like.</p>
<p>It's gpt-3 ok so it's training data goes up to like 2 or 3 years ago so it doesn't know anything that's happened in the last 2 or 3 years.</p>
<p>Do you know what weathering waves is it doesn't know what anything that happened in the last few years we can look it up.</p>
<p>It's 3.5 turbo.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>Up to september's in.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>I will see you next time resources first.</p>
<p>Try and clean up what's around the vicinity.</p>
<p>There's a lot of speakable people.</p>
<p>Well I can speak to him I can speak to him and I can speak to him.</p>
<p>I'm not in a very talkative mood.</p>
<p>Instead one is to find out where this blood.</p>
<p>Squiggly dears and put it on top of this.</p>
<p>This is why you made this is this I see it now.</p>
<p>Clear to me there's also a chest over there and the torch that wanted lightning was around here somewhere I know it was.</p>
<p>I still don't see it though.</p>
<p>There was definitely a torch around here somewhere.</p>
<p>We need our boys.</p>
<p>I'm not killing the goats no i'm not doing it.</p>
<p>The guards are innocent bystanders ok they have nothing to do with these slimes.</p>
<p>If I find out the working with them.</p>
<p>They will die.</p>
<p>Ok you have to die.</p>
<p>Because clearly I don't get the chest until you die.</p>
<p>Tell him tell him.</p>
<p>And I still don't know where that torch went but I don't have clean anymore so I suppose it doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>This guy looks like he's up to no good.</p>
<p>You don't squat on a cliff.</p>
<p>If you're an upstanding citizen of tavas i'll tell you that for now.</p>
<p>These goats are in on it i'm telling you.</p>
<p>It's some kind of got gang.</p>
<p>Yes I think it's organised crime.</p>
<p>Now if it was sheep I wouldn't be suspicious.</p>
<p>Here before originally and I swear the.</p>
<p>Will the trees all blue like that and it's probably just that it's probably just the tree.</p>
<p>The trees blue shining through.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Where's the final one the final one where are you.</p>
<p>Down where are you.</p>
<p>How smile.</p>
<p>Waste of energy.</p>
<p>Rice ok there's.</p>
<p>Is that tree blue is that the blue tree.</p>
<p>What are we looking at.</p>
<p>Is that the train leave.</p>
<p>Any tree I guess.</p>
<p>It just looks.</p>
<p>Did the blue looks weird talking through.</p>
<p>There is a blue tree in this game i'm sure there is but isn't that up near.</p>
<p>Is it like over by the desert or whatever isn't that this one.</p>
<p>The blue tree.</p>
<p>In the west.</p>
<p>And I don't think we can see it from over the waterfall.</p>
<p>So now i'm really curious about this other tree with the.</p>
<p>With the blue shining through it right let's get a look at this.</p>
<p>I guess we could do that.</p>
<p>But at the same time it's not.</p>
<p>In a part of the map that.</p>
<p>How expected the tree that I thought it was to be in some now i'm really curious.</p>
<p>Play some clarification on that.</p>
<p>It's part of my tree research.</p>
<p>Venture ok let's just go over there.</p>
<p>Don't think just do.</p>
<p>Get up there.</p>
<p>How do I get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>By getting to the top of this.</p>
<p>That sounds kind of counterproductive.</p>
<p>John deere.</p>
<p>Is a jumpy jump.</p>
<p>Resonance.</p>
<p>Stop there.</p>
<p>Gone gone.</p>
<p>Get up up up car.</p>
<p>Up up.</p>
<p>I definitely been around all around here.</p>
<p>Stamina.</p>
<p>Is this good.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>Everything under control on all times.</p>
<p>Where was that tree.</p>
<p>It's that over there let me just face it a second.</p>
<p>That's why I was confused I was like wait what.</p>
<p>That makes perfect sense it just looks it looks a bit weird talking through the fog and I think that tree is all supposed to like all kind of blue yeah it's the one in the desert.</p>
<p>Make sense.</p>
<p>And I don't know the way the fog was or whatever the blue shining through the fog just looked a bit weird.</p>
<p>Call trees blue I think but it was only.</p>
<p>Did not detect any bullshit apparently zero bullshit in this area.</p>
<p>Last disappointing.</p>
<p>Give me an air con give me something.</p>
<p>Ok what do you think.</p>
<p>That's a pretty big ravine.</p>
<p>A female river.</p>
<p>I mean the best case scenarios that we can land on.</p>
<p>Farina.</p>
<p>Are minions.</p>
<p>Can you be dead by the time.</p>
<p>We land.</p>
<p>For now just look at our food I want sprinting and swimming reduction that's what i'm looking for.</p>
<p>Sprinting.</p>
<p>I'm swimming.</p>
<p>Climbing in sprinting.</p>
<p>Time in sprinting climbing and sprinting gliding and sprinting.</p>
<p>Gliding swimming.</p>
<p>Is there such a thing.</p>
<p>Sprinting gliding and swimming.</p>
<p>Who is this who are these people.</p>
<p>Give me sprinting and swimming.</p>
<p>Why would you want anything else.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>Everything is sprinting.</p>
<p>I'm leaving olympics.</p>
<p>Gliding in sprinting noah klose gliding and swimming.</p>
<p>Gliding and swimming climbing in spring.</p>
<p>Climbing and sprinting.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>There's no like gliding and swimming.</p>
<p>Can we use is there a is there must be a swimming one right I don't even see the single swimming one.</p>
<p>Write the stamina ones all have.</p>
<p>Call categorise together right.</p>
<p>Climbing and sprinting climbing and sprinting climbing and sprinting.</p>
<p>This is stupid.</p>
<p>Who asked for this.</p>
<p>Show yourself right now.</p>
<p>Explain yourself why would you ever ask for this.</p>
<p>Colliding and swimming we need.</p>
<p>So stupid.</p>
<p>I guess i'll use this one.</p>
<p>Either of these is fine let's just use this one.</p>
<p>Nothing helps with swimming.</p>
<p>That's kind of weird.</p>
<p>Ok we're heading towards the tree.</p>
<p>Ok now we are past the show the point of no return.</p>
<p>Our minions are going to be gone by the time we hit the water I think.</p>
<p>There's not not a chance in halloween making it so that ireland.</p>
<p>The only way we really could have done it.</p>
<p>Is it.</p>
<p>If we we did our minions right before we set off.</p>
<p>And then we kind of like plunged down to the ocean pretty quickly are we going to drown as well.</p>
<p>Yeah we can't get our minions out now.</p>
<p>What kind of what kind of fucked.</p>
<p>Now what we can do.</p>
<p>Is we can restore.</p>
<p>100 stamina is that the biggest I think it is.</p>
<p>Would you get out fish and chips out in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>Go to sleep 7 hours.</p>
<p>Do me sounds nice but it's not bedtime yet.</p>
<p>I can't believe there's no swimming stamina reduction what the heck is that about.</p>
<p>We're not going to make it to the islands.</p>
<p>8 hours actually this is the 8th.</p>
<p>Woodhead.</p>
<p>Where is he dead.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>Boost.</p>
<p>We start gliding.</p>
<p>We have to clear the show though.</p>
<p>We don't have to we could just run across the land I guess.</p>
<p>Cos we need to make sure our minions are still alive.</p>
<p>I'm going to make it to the tree.</p>
<p>Yeah so 8 hours it's been we've got the 8 hour ad break.</p>
<p>In effect right now actually.</p>
<p>And then i'm going to go get some food.</p>
<p>Stream is about to end.</p>
<p>The first I just want to make it to the tree.</p>
<p>Just drown already just drown just drown.</p>
<p>I forgot to.</p>
<p>So are you saying bad or has.</p>
<p>Call me.</p>
<p>Cookie has a passive that makes people use less swimming stamina.</p>
<p>Where's beto that's better.</p>
<p>But we need to make sure on landing off to.</p>
<p>Do weird fog.</p>
<p>Why is it look like this.</p>
<p>It looks like origami.</p>
<p>What was the point in the swimming thing.</p>
<p>Well just in case we end up swimming because don't ask me they go and see it now don't ask me might forget to pop the minions again.</p>
<p>Minions minions minions.</p>
<p>Oh my god it's so far.</p>
<p>It's so far.</p>
<p>Tell anna zuma.</p>
<p>But then that was changing veil which was more recent so they could have added a way of writer I don't know if they did.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>On this island so we can we can pick up a ball even better or.</p>
<p>How hot is beneath me.</p>
<p>See I told you I was near it's ok it's ok.</p>
<p>Eat.</p>
<p>Rice pudding with why I always have rice pudding on me by the way.</p>
<p>We can't give up now.</p>
<p>Right I do think it's a little bit silly that farina can't summon her minions from in the water.</p>
<p>I mean she's the goddess of.</p>
<p>Water.</p>
<p>What about today.</p>
<p>200 seconds.</p>
<p>239 seconds.</p>
<p>Can I switch.</p>
<p>Cancel characters.</p>
<p>Can't pop the skill.</p>
<p>I don't even know if one more refresh is going to be enough.</p>
<p>Am I even be quicker to start again at this point.</p>
<p>Are we were so close.</p>
<p>We're doing this.</p>
<p>Little hiccup slide hiccup.</p>
<p>Sing too bad.</p>
<p>You know what else we can do is we could use anything.</p>
<p>Ok it's.</p>
<p>Yes ma'am.</p>
<p>Time on my mum.</p>
<p>Then again.</p>
<p>You probably find those like bite marks and all your food just like she was hungry and she had most of her.</p>
<p>What is happening to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Ok that was weird.</p>
<p>Where i'm going the wrong way.</p>
<p>Where did the island go.</p>
<p>Everything's really weird everything looks really weird.</p>
<p>Appeared.</p>
<p>Expect you to do stuff like this.</p>
<p>When's peregian and stuff like that.</p>
<p>And so you start a transitioning in and out of those that things start a little bit weird sometimes.</p>
<p>It's extra risky sprinting.</p>
<p>Because if I run out of stamina and I forget to put my skill.</p>
<p>How much closer to drowning.</p>
<p>Set the in terms of like mobile.</p>
<p>Games that you can play on mobile it definitely like breaks all the barriers and others probably been bigger.</p>
<p>Play games the nest bigger world's maybe the witcher 3.</p>
<p>Maybe something like star citizen or something like that.</p>
<p>Both of them.</p>
<p>Is stephanie breaks older.</p>
<p>Records for like.</p>
<p>How much does being able to deal with just.</p>
<p>A consumer engine like this.</p>
<p>Give me the give me the ball.</p>
<p>Give me the ball give me the ball.</p>
<p>I trust you more than serena.</p>
<p>To sell your bored.</p>
<p>But maybe not maybe like.</p>
<p>Twinkle boots with the water.</p>
<p>When you're essentially working against it.</p>
<p>How far we can take the weather because it looks like there's like a little colder cycle something.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Not very.</p>
<p>There was a river.</p>
<p>Can we still have carrara.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>More stamina please.</p>
<p>Can we make it.</p>
<p>Almost there.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm trying to remember because there was was a waterfall there.</p>
<p>Yeah this must be what I was thinking of I remember the being like a river.</p>
<p>Climbing.</p>
<p>I gotta stop using on my stomach when I start climbing overnight.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let the stamina charge it is for your own good ok let's go back.</p>
<p>We made it no scorpions.</p>
<p>Where's the tree.</p>
<p>That is not where I thought it would be ok.</p>
<p>I guess I got.</p>
<p>Turn around and we can actually.</p>
<p>I'm taking you on now.</p>
<p>I'm telling you to a tree now carla is like the ultimate tree.</p>
<p>Set the trees.</p>
<p>If teresa her bed.</p>
<p>Bed chester we'll call it bedchester where does bedford that's amazing bedford maybe bedford is just i've never been about it maybe it's just a giant bed.</p>
<p>I can't remember how do we get in the tree do we have to climb up it and then dives down the middle because there is like a win.</p>
<p>Am I in it now.</p>
<p>Let's check it out.</p>
<p>I want a reminder.</p>
<p>Was less like restrictions on exploration than even genshin.</p>
<p>And then they've gone and watched that massively.</p>
<p>With the new apaches does a new tower of fantasy in the new area that they put a massive barrier around.</p>
<p>Why would you do that.</p>
<p>Who wants to be restricted.</p>
<p>Barriers.</p>
<p>Is for exploration.</p>
<p>Seem to remember I seem to remember being able to go inside the tree.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Take a cry you wanted to treat asleep in.</p>
<p>Did I need to do something with those.</p>
<p>I don't even remember how these work.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly.</p>
<p>What are grapes to leave at.</p>
<p>Well worth it well worth all the parents.</p>
<p>Do you have friends you need to.</p>
<p>Sort it out sarah fantasy alright that's one of the like in many ways I prefer to her fantasy to wuthering wares.</p>
<p>Pause the shit out of me.</p>
<p>I think everybody knows that by now.</p>
<p>When when you take good ingredients.</p>
<p>Ingredients are good.</p>
<p>The meal should be decent.</p>
<p>But there are so many ways you can mix those ingredients.</p>
<p>Gourmet dish as far as i'm concerned.</p>
<p>The tastiest the tastiest meal you can make with those ingredients and other games to try to copy it I just kind of you know cheap knock.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily mean that bad.</p>
<p>What's the weather in sometimes.</p>
<p>It's.</p>
<p>It's gonna hobbling along on one leg with one eye.</p>
<p>Disconnect to be sent to a farm soon to go and live with all the other.</p>
<p>Games.</p>
<p>I mean retired.</p>
<p>Old dogs.</p>
<p>Cheers rabbits all day you know what i'm saying and yeah.</p>
<p>I'm not feeling.</p>
<p>I'm not feeling this flea ridden wuthering waves as much as everybody else's but I guess we'll see where it ends up.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Enough dog analogies let's leave it there.</p>
<p>With a debug text on my screen so is boo still alive.</p>
<p>I think it isn't it's going to be one of these things where it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>I can see the time on neck is all twisted.</p>
<p>Maybe I need to look at rotational data yeah there's definitely some issues with agent over time of not as the like they kind of.</p>
<p>I'll be back on tomorrow thank you.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
