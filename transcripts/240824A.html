<h3>From Live stream on Saturday 24-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkyOJA56fzs​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkyOJA56fzs​</a></h3>
<p>Right I think we're good.</p>
<p>Mini games.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>That should be finishing up.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>It was so random well somebody mentioned trainspotting.</p>
<p>In a youtube video recently and I was like oh my god what's the filming ages I remember that being a good film.</p>
<p>Am I watching sequels about the sequels and very good.</p>
<p>College.</p>
<p>And transporting it come out well.</p>
<p>And during that it got mentioned it's danny boyle I think.</p>
<p>Is there a accident and I will teach you mentioned another one called shallow grave that I hadn't seen who he also that he also directed that one also has a ewan mcgregor in.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>So I watch the second half of that.</p>
<p>Tonight I guess it still says add break ends I don't know whether this adds or not twitches and.</p>
<p>Which is is being crazy.</p>
<p>Excuse my throat as well.</p>
<p>Issues I was having so now I believe it's a little bit exciting because we get to work on something new at last.</p>
<p>Yes I need to put that back in as well.</p>
<p>Which is cancelling ghost foods.</p>
<p>Yes I have cancel was pressed and you cancel your move then we we reset ghost foods.</p>
<p>Which is going to be called drop delay.</p>
<p>And for now i'm going to set it to half a second.</p>
<p>Make a small delay before the food drops so if we hit play now we should be at a point where it makes the match highlights the cells through all the current food at paimon scores the player so the next thing that needs to happen so if we just.</p>
<p>Baby give us some pizza.</p>
<p>All the food above these three squares needs to drop down to fill the gap and then we need to generate food where.</p>
<p>Weather new gavis right.</p>
<p>But we might want.</p>
<p>The food 2 which is what throws the food at the time on so there you go we can see here where are we this is where play get some march we get the horizontal matches we get the vertical matches in both instances we throw the food at prime on innovation index.</p>
<p>Can we come out.</p>
<p>So since we do separate for horizontal and separate for vertical.</p>
<p>Oh yeah.</p>
<p>What this is why I was doing the cell the cell background thing.</p>
<p>Call a cell.</p>
<p>Right so the main reason I started doing the cell backgrounds thing is so that I could make sure I was identifying the cells correctly.</p>
<p>Yeah so the horizontal matches these are the cells.</p>
<p>Cuz obviously let's get our snipping clips.</p>
<p>Ballpoint pen.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Then obviously we're going to need to affect three cells above.</p>
<p>The length of the match if that makes sense so we can sort of get our head around what we need to be doing now so we can figure out the length of the month but sometimes you get a really complicated match right.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might get a match like that.</p>
<p>But then h matches is going to detect that part of it v matches is going to detect that part of it so either way I think we're good.</p>
<p>So basically within h matches what we want to do is we want to go one up and apply the job go on up apply the job go one up and play the drop for the length of the march right.</p>
<p>The vertical matches it's different.</p>
<p>Convertible matches we just want to go up.</p>
<p>The top match.</p>
<p>And then drop that down but also.</p>
<p>The horizontal matches were only going to be dropping food 1 square but for vertical matches we're going to be dropping food the length of the match.</p>
<p>I think I think what we probably do rather than.</p>
<p>Horizontal horizontal matching and vertical matching had to be separate.</p>
<p>Which is because of the weather numbers work right so if we look at.</p>
<p>The numbers right because horizontal matches we could just basically plus 1 + 1 + 1 and we knew that the the cell numbers iterated like increased.</p>
<p>Get in sequence right with the vertical matches they they don't they obviously increase by grid with.</p>
<p>Sorry essentially need a different mathematical functions from each other.</p>
<p>What's if this board was a played board right now.</p>
<p>And we've already set the food across the time on it would probably be better to identify the gaps I would think.</p>
<p>So all this is to say I think it would be better.</p>
<p>If we made a new function which specifically did this specifically scan the board.</p>
<p>Four holes.</p>
<p>I went to the food above those holes so every every food that exists above a hole will drop down and fill the hole.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Is this gets even more complicated because.</p>
<p>We need to animate it as well so that this gets really can't get this is why I added it to the left float.</p>
<p>So basically.</p>
<p>This to happen first.</p>
<p>The next thing that needs to happen.</p>
<p>Is we scan ball.</p>
<p>For empty cells.</p>
<p>Turn the next thing that needs to happen is.</p>
<p>We apply drop animation to each food cell above empty cell.</p>
<p>And with that there needs to be.</p>
<p>Like a second drop delay as it were.</p>
<p>Wait for animations to end.</p>
<p>And then at the end of the animation.</p>
<p>So this is the way it's going to have to work.</p>
<p>So here's how this works.</p>
<p>What kind of complicated.</p>
<p>Because here's how it has to work.</p>
<p>What's actually going to happen is we're actually going to take this sell here and we're going to animate it so that it drops down at this sell here.</p>
<p>The problem with that.</p>
<p>Is this object is still this cell.</p>
<p>Even though it's now been repositioned at this cell.</p>
<p>So we we don't have a sell anymore back here so what we have to do is we create an illusion so what essentially we do is we play the animation so that the play can see the food drops down into the less sell.</p>
<p>Excel then we do a great sleight of hand magicians.</p>
<p>Where essentially what we do is we.</p>
<p>Stop the contents.</p>
<p>We put the cell back to where it was that's the first thing we need to do so then we need to put the cell back.</p>
<p>And at the same time and swap the contents.</p>
<p>So it creates the illusion that the food just dropped down what really happened is the food drop down and then the cell went back up to where it was and we put the food in the cells below but we do it in one frame so it just looks like the food drop down but what really happened is we swap the food cells now we could just do that if we didn't want animations and it would make life a hell of a lot easier we could literally just put the food one cell below put the food once upon put the food once i'll be low.</p>
<p>It's not going to be very sophisticated it's essentially that is what we're doing but the tricky part is making it look good right so the making it look good is making it appear as if the food drops down from one cell to the other but what's really happening is the cell is moving to the cell below then it swaps back up in the content swap it exactly the same time.</p>
<p>Cancel now the foods in the correct cell the cells are in the correct.</p>
<p>And you know we can recalculate everything best on that.</p>
<p>And we basically need to rinse and repeat for any additional calls.</p>
<p>So then we need to rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>For additional gaps additional empty cells for example vertical matches.</p>
<p>Travel like vertical length.</p>
<p>Vertical matches will need to drop more than one position.</p>
<p>Depending on how long the match was.</p>
<p>And then finally when we've done all that.</p>
<p>Play recheck the board.</p>
<p>The new matches.</p>
<p>Getting lucky and scarring extra points and stuff like that.</p>
<p>That is a lot.</p>
<p>Ok so what i'm going to start by doing is at the end of.</p>
<p>At the end of the match function.</p>
<p>Play a match.</p>
<p>I am going to start a quarantine.</p>
<p>Call it.</p>
<p>Drop.</p>
<p>Foods I guess.</p>
<p>Drop foods.</p>
<p>We need to put a yield return knowledge of return something.</p>
<p>And actually we can change this here.</p>
<p>To yield return weight for seconds drop delay.</p>
<p>What that will do is it will wait whatever time we've got from the drop delay then we can start the coroutine and drop foods.</p>
<p>And for now and then drop foods i'm just going to do a debug.</p>
<p>Set alarm.</p>
<p>A mixture of everything.</p>
<p>Trigger's at the right time.</p>
<p>Dude will drop.</p>
<p>Working properly.</p>
<p>Up to this point.</p>
<p>We should have a 0.5 second and I dropped away.</p>
<p>It's private it's a private variable ok.</p>
<p>Why is it not running.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>I said food will drop now.</p>
<p>Well that's weird.</p>
<p>Does it run player match.</p>
<p>Is it generates the food.</p>
<p>Is that just because i'm clicking the board.</p>
<p>Ok we have to be careful here because it looks like play match is checking for matches even when we don't have much as so when I first click into the game it checks for marches and I just moved something that didn't create a match right.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>I love that in this game.</p>
<p>So if you want to you can swap two things around even though they want create a match.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>I need to be aware of that.</p>
<p>They might not always be a match.</p>
<p>Ok but let's test it for when there is a march.</p>
<p>That's weird I never knew it was doing.</p>
<p>You feel like that needs fixing actually.</p>
<p>I'm making a move then it shouldn't be checking for matches.</p>
<p>Yeah let me see that actually.</p>
<p>That's kind of weird.</p>
<p>Cuz I was messing around with the inspector and I clicked off and then I lose I lose focus on the game so to get focus back on the game and to get my interface back I just clicked into the game now when I click into the game even i'm making a move.</p>
<p>Do it this time mother.</p>
<p>It was do it I was doing the.</p>
<p>Weird anywhere ok food will drop down.</p>
<p>Ok so the first thing we're going to need to do is look at our food squares.</p>
<p>For now let's put like a burger in the mall.</p>
<p>Ok at the moment we have two animations on the food squares we have food normal and we have food shake.</p>
<p>So I think what we're going to need to do is create a food drop animation.</p>
<p>So let's attempt that.</p>
<p>Where are the other animations for this then.</p>
<p>Apparently.</p>
<p>But it doesn't have ok let me just drop that in the foods alameda.</p>
<p>Food drops registered as an animation.</p>
<p>In the anime in the animator.</p>
<p>But when i'm on a food item.</p>
<p>It's not showing.</p>
<p>Now why the hell would that be.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It says it's got an animation in in the.</p>
<p>Ok I don't trust this animation.</p>
<p>As far as I can throw it.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>It needs to show in this.</p>
<p>Food drop.</p>
<p>Ok so hit record.</p>
<p>Enable disable.</p>
<p>Yeah it's not really position it's wrecked transform position y.</p>
<p>So i'm going to guess.</p>
<p>Are we using local position which should start at y0.</p>
<p>Remove all of them.</p>
<p>That's not good ok let's just concentrate on one cell then.</p>
<p>Let's take.</p>
<p>Burger number four.</p>
<p>What's behind burger number 4 is it a lettuce is it a radish.</p>
<p>Is it some cheese.</p>
<p>No it's time on.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>I guess position why.</p>
<p>I get houston we have a problem.</p>
<p>Oh lord we have a problem.</p>
<p>Ok so the problem i'm seeing is the why is the cell positions of the food items vary depending on where they are in the grid.</p>
<p>Yes I know.</p>
<p>Because that would be it's local position in respect to its parent which is the food squares grid.</p>
<p>If we were going to use the animation we would have to make food a child component for each cell that way the foods local position would be in respect to itself rather than in respect to the grid because if we play if we apply and respect to the grid then if we move a burger from this position to this position every single burger will move from this position to this.</p>
<p>Specifically.</p>
<p>Relative to its.</p>
<p>Sell parents but at the moment it's only got grid as the parent.</p>
<p>Which is a bit of a pan in the ass.</p>
<p>Because do I really want to make.</p>
<p>What is the best way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>This is a real problem.</p>
<p>What I should have done is I should have made.</p>
<p>Food a separate object which was a child of the cell.</p>
<p>That's what I should have done.</p>
<p>Ok let's get super messy super fast.</p>
<p>Mathematically.</p>
<p>I feel like that might be the safe way to let's try ok let's try and do this mathematically so I want to try and explain what the problem is right.</p>
<p>The problem is right if we look at these numbers hear the way to think about the way to think about these right well you have to understand about the inspector and object orientation unity is these numbers are not they're not like a set of coordinates well they are but they're in respect to something.</p>
<p>Back to the parent right so what this cell is saying is that it's a negative 40 in respect to food squares right so in the animator if I move it from -40 in the animator to down to their lock downwards it's.</p>
<p>142 for example.</p>
<p>What it's essentially saying is we want you to take your local negative.</p>
<p>142.</p>
<p>What that would do is if we apply the animation to a burger down here it would jump up here to -40 because this is where -40 is and then it would go back down to this raw here because that's where it was when we animated this burger right.</p>
<p>So how do you how do you fix that how the hell do you move all these burgers independently.</p>
<p>They have to be in respect to a parent.</p>
<p>That has separate coordinates like a separate area from the greatest hall which is what these cells are right these cells are separate areas separate objects within the grid.</p>
<p>So if we move if we move the cells themselves.</p>
<p>Like we we have to move them to exact positions in respect to the grid so that the way I should have set this up in hindsight now is I should have made the food object a child of each cell so each one of these cells should have a child which is the food object then if we moved the child from zero local in respect to itself position down to negative 140 or whatever the hell right then whenever we apply the animation to any of those burgers they would essentially move away from their parent which is their self position right so they don't jump up to wherever they're supposed to go so but that could mess a lot of things up because this whole thing has been.</p>
<p>Not place that where we could.</p>
<p>We could restructure this.</p>
<p>We're never going to drop food from the bottom raw cos even if somebody was a match 3 genius and they cleared like tetris and they cleared like this entire bottom raw the only burgers that are going to drop down to fill the gap but the ones above so we don't have to worry about moving burgers out of bounds if that makes sense right we only need to worry about moving burgers from food above.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to solve this problem.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think what the best way is.</p>
<p>Pick us another way we could do it.</p>
<p>So that's one way of doing it right which is essentially we take the burgers above we drag them down then we do a magician sleight of hand swap and put the cells back to where there was supposed to be bloody bloody blah.</p>
<p>After the fact.</p>
<p>But I think what would be another way of doing it which might be a better way of doing a tight-knit system is basically.</p>
<p>Any food that generates.</p>
<p>Yeah we might be able to do a better job let me just think about this.</p>
<p>What's a better system.</p>
<p>What's what would be better.</p>
<p>If I could have a dream system of how this would work how would I make it work and I guess the way I would make it work is as a food item is generated right as a food item is is spawned from the heavens that's what does it literally starts out of bounds.</p>
<p>It generates out of bounds.</p>
<p>Is each food item knows which sell it belongs to and will seamlessly drop from the sky and land into its respective cell.</p>
<p>Because if I have that system then at the start of the game the food animates.</p>
<p>As much as occur in new food generates in animates that's still actually to be fair that still wouldn't solve this problem because.</p>
<p>Warm is isn't the food generating necessarily.</p>
<p>God dammit this is tricky.</p>
<p>Tricky yeah there are so many ways it might be better to make the food act like that like a better system.</p>
<p>A better system might be to.</p>
<p>Put some cord on each one of these food items right that basically gets the food to be responsible for its own like gravity system or whatever where the food is basically checking the cell below and says hang on a minute.</p>
<p>Is there a space beneath me if there is then i'm going to move into that space.</p>
<p>But again.</p>
<p>We can't even make it work that way because like I said the cells have to stay where they are this is what makes this so tricky write the cell has to stay where it is ultimately.</p>
<p>We can create an effect by temporarily moving the cell from one x which is what I was originally going to do and then swap it back at the last minute.</p>
<p>But ultimately the cell has to stay where the cell is otherwise you know everything falls apart.</p>
<p>It essentially changes cells right it's supposed to change cells.</p>
<p>This is so tricky.</p>
<p>Lol.</p>
<p>Okay I think i'm all the thinking it though.</p>
<p>I think as long as we have a function.</p>
<p>I think to keep it simple right as long as we have a function.</p>
<p>The anime to sell right.</p>
<p>I think about it all I really need is a function that says hey.</p>
<p>I want you to become a magician sell right and moving cell and what are you going to do is you're going to move down to the cell below.</p>
<p>Then you got a hot swap your contents with the cell that you swapped with and then you got to return to your respective position.</p>
<p>And as long as that as long as we can make that a smooth function then we can just give it to all the cells that it applies to I think that's what we need to start start by doing.</p>
<p>So let me just get my logical brain around this.</p>
<p>So we would have a gap.</p>
<p>You know what I need to see ok let's take a screenshot because my brand is struggling to visualise this.</p>
<p>So let's play a game.</p>
<p>Let's play a game.</p>
<p>And make a match.</p>
<p>That's a big one.</p>
<p>You are a magician whatever a drop cell will call it a drop sell you now become a drop sell your job is to move into the empty cell below.</p>
<p>Temporarily.</p>
<p>Then you're going to give that sell that's that's essentially we're going to do so let's flash this out.</p>
<p>What the hell did.</p>
<p>Iphone 7 my text is better or is bucket is back good good ok yeah so essentially a drop drop cell functions for example.</p>
<p>You going to move to sell below.</p>
<p>You gonna give that sell.</p>
<p>Your food.</p>
<p>You going to return to original position.</p>
<p>After emptying yourself empty yourself.</p>
<p>So essentially.</p>
<p>Which creates a new gap here.</p>
<p>But I will really doing.</p>
<p>Is this.</p>
<p>However this might not be the correct rule because in this instance ok let's think about it drop sell so if this this this this cup would say i'm a cop I go down to the I go down to the space I give the space my cup and then I become a space and I go back here the problem with that is this cup's doing the same thing so this cup then says hey.</p>
<p>Cop i'm a cup to i'm.</p>
<p>Make you a cup.</p>
<p>Where is that what would happen let me think about this.</p>
<p>Yeah I think this will work but obviously we have to be careful about the order we do this in if if we start we need this will work as long as we work our way up so these cells must run from bottom to top.</p>
<p>Right because if you think about it.</p>
<p>This cup needs to swap itself with the space then go back to being a space.</p>
<p>If it works the other way around if we if we gave the cells from top to bottom.</p>
<p>So how do we do this I have no idea no we can do this we can do this.</p>
<p>Ok so we're going to call this.</p>
<p>Drop food.</p>
<p>And drop food is going to take a cell number so we're going to take an integer of a cell number.</p>
<p>So now we can't just start the car routine we have to iterate through all the gaps so we still need to find the gaps actually.</p>
<p>We need to find all empty cells so if you think about it let's just flesh out all we need to do we need to find all empty cells.</p>
<p>And then we need to loop run discord routine.</p>
<p>From bottom to top.</p>
<p>Yes this is what we need to do.</p>
<p>100% but.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>I want to I want to get I want to make sure.</p>
<p>So what i'm going to do instead is.</p>
<p>I need a cell number.</p>
<p>Grab index is where we grab the food from right so grab index should now be.</p>
<p>Shouldn't grab index now be a.</p>
<p>An empty cell.</p>
<p>I need to know where the grab index is an empty cell so we can test it.</p>
<p>I think I can say drop food grabbing.</p>
<p>Drop will food will now drop.</p>
<p>For sale.</p>
<p>And then we'll see what cell number it was it received.</p>
<p>So let me try that so all I want to do now is make sure.</p>
<p>That for one cell test only.</p>
<p>We're giving it we're actually giving it an empty cell.</p>
<p>Is it an empty cell wall.</p>
<p>This function wants to run on food above cells.</p>
<p>So for this test it needs to be grabbed index so bring those numbers up it should be grabbing the x - grid with rice cos if this is bring out numbers up.</p>
<p>If we if our food was grabbed from 17 and matched with 24 we want to drop food from 10 so it would be grabbing decks minus grid cell width grid with.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Silhouette.</p>
<p>Grids.</p>
<p>Good size there we go good size.</p>
<p>Witnessing a miracle here cos I genuinely feel like I understand this and it's.</p>
<p>It's rare that I was clear as I am right now.</p>
<p>I'm not saying I can do every single part of this like they're not saying I won't run into problems i'm just saying I understand exactly what I need to do right now I think right so i'm going to match these cups.</p>
<p>And what we should see it should come back and say hey.</p>
<p>I'm about to drop sell three.</p>
<p>That will be the french fries above the cup right.</p>
<p>There is no cup match there what the fuck am I even talk about yellow is.</p>
<p>-8 what the hell.</p>
<p>What is that how did it come back negative 8.</p>
<p>What is that.</p>
<p>So what the hell was our grab index.</p>
<p>Why was the what or maybe we reset grab index to zero because we were no longer holding food.</p>
<p>Yes yes by the time we get down here grab index is gone we've already forgotten where we grabbed it.</p>
<p>So how am I going to do a quick dirty sell test for this then.</p>
<p>That's a good question.</p>
<p>Okay the way we get a quick dirty sell test for this is we make an integer and we call it temp dirty test.</p>
<p>And for now will set it to negative one.</p>
<p>And then as we get our grab index and we do our matches.</p>
<p>Before we reset grabbing next where am I even resetting grabbing decks.</p>
<p>Are you a sia.</p>
<p>We lost it by the time we get to play matches then.</p>
<p>Ok well let's let's take a closer look at our code write our code.</p>
<p>I record gives.</p>
<p>Food squares at start index plus iteration index.</p>
<p>What's the last match count at position match index.</p>
<p>Good god I forgot how complicated this is.</p>
<p>I think I store a list of cells that are matched against.</p>
<p>In an arrow something.</p>
<p>So we give the throw.</p>
<p>An object from food squares of start index which must be the start of where the match occurred yeah I understand that now.</p>
<p>Yeah so we we give it a start index cos it's either gonna be because for h much as it goes along right for v matches it goes down so are we really need is the start index of the match in both functions and we just do things differently mathematically depending on the length of the match.</p>
<p>So we can use start index I think.</p>
<p>I think we can use start index.</p>
<p>Sing me try this is me desperately trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Building.</p>
<p>Okay but they're ok there within the isolated functions I do need a quick and dirty so I need a.</p>
<p>Put dirty test.</p>
<p>What's -1 then when we find the start index.</p>
<p>Before we drop out of this isolated function we say temp dirty test equals start index so we can remember it then we do the same thing at the end of this isolated function.</p>
<p>And then we can send start test.</p>
<p>Sell 15 needs to be dropped.</p>
<p>We didn't have that number anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah so it's 10:30 test - grid size.</p>
<p>Is what it is.</p>
<p>Ok now.</p>
<p>I swear now.</p>
<p>This is going to give us a valid sell to test it on.</p>
<p>It's just a five.</p>
<p>Ok so pita slice would be our guinea pig here sell 5 and identified as the food it needs to be dropped so let's see if we can make this work so now we want to function.</p>
<p>This function needs to take the cell it needs to do what we put in that notepad right we need to move it down to the cell below.</p>
<p>Hot swap the contents.</p>
<p>Peter said hi kathy i'm not sure when that was.</p>
<p>I can't debug that right now.</p>
<p>Where to deep into this.</p>
<p>Right so the cell we want to drop with is so what we can do is we need we need the first thing we need to store is our original position right so we're going to make a vector 3 a vector 2 rather make a vector 2 and we're going to call it original position and we're going to say original position equals food squares at position cell number dot transform dot local position we must use a local position.</p>
<p>Unless we use the rect transform direct transform might be better actually.</p>
<p>Was that from youtube or is he only talking twitch now.</p>
<p>Right we might be better off using rex transform I think.</p>
<p>Position and we're only using the y axis so actually we could store this in a float.</p>
<p>What we want to do is.</p>
<p>The number of frames we want to drop with this in.</p>
<p>So for example we want it to drop within half a second we might set it to like 30 frames or something like that I don't even know.</p>
<p>What do you think about this.</p>
<p>Still 1.2 f so we've got.</p>
<p>Restore the original position.</p>
<p>Can we can do the vector 2 and get the.</p>
<p>Target position.</p>
<p>I guess a tiger position equals food squares.</p>
<p>Add cell number.</p>
<p>What's grid size.</p>
<p>Because that is the that is the cell below.</p>
<p>Rex transform dot position.</p>
<p>And then what we want to do is we want to say.</p>
<p>Essentially want to move the food square.</p>
<p>Move.</p>
<p>Sell from.</p>
<p>To target position.</p>
<p>Add speed.</p>
<p>And then when it reaches the end.</p>
<p>We want to say we need to do the swapping of the swapping of items.</p>
<p>That's going to be.</p>
<p>Tricky as well.</p>
<p>So our target cell.</p>
<p>Contains.</p>
<p>Is it clear cells.</p>
<p>So we want to play cells.</p>
<p>Sell square.</p>
<p>Target cell.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Cell number.</p>
<p>We need this parrot here.</p>
<p>Which is sell parents.</p>
<p>Add position cell number.</p>
<p>Post grid size.</p>
<p>Don't get components.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>No we've got grid cells hang on a minute.</p>
<p>Cells.</p>
<p>List.</p>
<p>Yes grid cells ok.</p>
<p>So we better off just saying grid cells.</p>
<p>Add positions cell number plus grid size.</p>
<p>And if we check that we have.</p>
<p>Sell index raw number.</p>
<p>Light on so food item.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Grid cells.</p>
<p>Cell number.</p>
<p>Food item.</p>
<p>An in grid cells.</p>
<p>Cell number.</p>
<p>What food item.</p>
<p>So what that's doing is.</p>
<p>Swap contents.</p>
<p>We're targets sell.</p>
<p>No I don't know whether updating the food item on a cell.</p>
<p>Whether I made this thing auto update itself on it so let's find out if I change cell zero.</p>
<p>French fry which is food item two to something else.</p>
<p>Ok it doesn't automatically update itself so we need to visually update itself now.</p>
<p>So for the visual update.</p>
<p>We need to say.</p>
<p>Add cell number.</p>
<p>Integer target cell.</p>
<p>Equal cell number plus grid size.</p>
<p>And then we can just say a target cell.</p>
<p>Target cell.</p>
<p>And then if we put it here.</p>
<p>We can put it here as well.</p>
<p>Target cell.</p>
<p>Get components.</p>
<p>Raw image.</p>
<p>Top texture.</p>
<p>Equals food.</p>
<p>Type.</p>
<p>Add position.</p>
<p>And it's that food item in each other.</p>
<p>Food type.</p>
<p>Well got a food.</p>
<p>So what we do is we got ok we got it's food type.</p>
<p>Search food type.</p>
<p>Disposition.</p>
<p>Food image.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So that's the visual update.</p>
<p>Ok so think this is what we need.</p>
<p>Can you help.</p>
<p>Remove the cell.</p>
<p>What's the position.</p>
<p>Ask set speed.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>It's fine.</p>
<p>Ok let me test that.</p>
<p>It will pick a test cell which is a cell above a piece of food that was that was marched and it should drop that food down.</p>
<p>Should swap the food with the food with the emptiness below the emptiness fill the emptiness with its food self and then we are going to want to set ourselves back to empty.</p>
<p>Which is which we didn't do yet actually we say cell number is food item -1 but we didn't do this part.</p>
<p>Right so we also need to say grid cells.</p>
<p>Cell number.</p>
<p>Don't get components.</p>
<p>Raw image.</p>
<p>Texture equals.</p>
<p>Empty texture as well.</p>
<p>This is a good one this is.</p>
<p>Project this one.</p>
<p>So the pizza.</p>
<p>Should move down into the gap.</p>
<p>And then that sell should become a pizza.</p>
<p>And the pizza should become empty.</p>
<p>Ok it said it was doing on psalm 9.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Ok so what happens is it did move if you look closely sell nine did move.</p>
<p>When did move far enough.</p>
<p>Ok I think it's because we're using local position.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I think the reason why.</p>
<p>Is because we used.</p>
<p>If we change local position.</p>
<p>What's the local position.</p>
<p>I don't want it again.</p>
<p>It's still doesn't work.</p>
<p>18 should have done the pizza slice.</p>
<p>That's not working at all.</p>
<p>Target cell is cell number plus grid size target position is food squares.</p>
<p>A target settle direct.</p>
<p>Set alarm for position.</p>
<p>So the first thing to check is.</p>
<p>Is this right is like.</p>
<p>What is the.</p>
<p>Original position vs the target position so if we do original position.</p>
<p>Close.</p>
<p>Target position.</p>
<p>In a debug I want to see what it comes back with.</p>
<p>Yeah so should be moving from 194 you probably can't see for my camera.</p>
<p>It should move from on the y-axis -92 down a negative 194.</p>
<p>Which is obviously not.</p>
<p>So this was on sale 9 which would be sell 10 in the inspector.</p>
<p>Which is the drink.</p>
<p>Right it is moving but it's moving ok it's moving insanely slowly ok this is quite good.</p>
<p>It's moving insanely slowly so let's try.</p>
<p>30 x 30.2 speed.</p>
<p>It is actually moving if you look at any inspector.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Ok it was that was still way too slow but it actually did the pizza slice slid down so now what we need to make sure is to make sure this cell return to its original position.</p>
<p>Let's check to see what it was it was sell 8 again which is selling inspector sell 9.</p>
<p>The pizza in it it should be empty.</p>
<p>Also it did become right so it never it never returned to its original position did we actually tell it to return to its original position now.</p>
<p>I don't think we did.</p>
<p>We need to also put it back to its original position.</p>
<p>Am I right so transform local position.</p>
<p>Equals original position.</p>
<p>Yeah but it also.</p>
<p>Had the wrong food item in it.</p>
<p>Texture equals empty texture food item equals negative 1.</p>
<p>Movement and completed ok so we need to make sure it completes it's movement and it actually gets to run this card so let's test that.</p>
<p>It is working but it's it's not fully working.</p>
<p>15 yeah ok stop 15 moved down.</p>
<p>Movement and completed.</p>
<p>Set did it on cell 15 which would be sell 16.</p>
<p>Is a drink.</p>
<p>Yeah it's it's in the wrong position.</p>
<p>Sell 16 should be returned to its original position.</p>
<p>Because if we go to the cell below.</p>
<p>So if we turn our numbers back on.</p>
<p>I'm guessing now what we have.</p>
<p>So sell 15 which is sell 16 which is here.</p>
<p>Broadcast foods I don't want I don't want any ghost foods be food suppliers.</p>
<p>Right so sell 16.</p>
<p>What position -346.</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>Is it -346 that's what I was worried about yeah it's not okay so it's not it's not returning to its position this is really weird.</p>
<p>Search not returning to its original position it's not swapping the move at the movement items the food items.</p>
<p>You don't need that debug anymore.</p>
<p>Does this one have the right food item in it.</p>
<p>23 no it doesn't it still empty what the fuck is going on unless something else is overriding it.</p>
<p>Unless something else is overwriting it.</p>
<p>But I don't think it will be.</p>
<p>Oh wait I know why.</p>
<p>I think I know why ok I think I know why ok here's why.</p>
<p>A grid cells contains grid cells contains the player cells rate the place sells is where we change the food item the texture isn't on grid cells.</p>
<p>The texture is.</p>
<p>On food squares.</p>
<p>Food squares.</p>
<p>And it wasn't food squares.</p>
<p>Food squares that's why yeah and then we're trying to return the position on grid cells we don't ever move grid cells it's food squares for food squares local position goes back to original position.</p>
<p>Ok ok I think we're good.</p>
<p>Yeah I forgot I forgot.</p>
<p>So basically grid cells has the database on it that contains the food items like.</p>
<p>Can't stop but the visual representation of the food is on a completely different object type.</p>
<p>Even though we'd actually have a much longer players to go so now what we really need to check now to know if this is working on it.</p>
<p>Ok it happened on sell 3 so sell two should be legitimately.</p>
<p>Sell two is a burger.</p>
<p>I haven't done sell three.</p>
<p>No didn't.</p>
<p>0123 oh yes I guess it did.</p>
<p>Socal 3 should be empty but it's a burger what the fuck is happening that can't be right so that means cell 2 is still down there.</p>
<p>Empty which is correct it should also be lined up with these other cells on a negative 40 which it is excellent.</p>
<p>Excellent so visually that's correct.</p>
<p>And so the cell beneath that it dropped down to what I probably should do is in my debug it's going to make it easier for me to check if I say in the debug where the target cells gonna be.</p>
<p>After calculating the target cell i'm going to move my debug.log down here and i'm going to say.</p>
<p>The cell that would do in it on and i'm going to say to target.</p>
<p>Set a target sale it just makes it easier for me to debug and in.</p>
<p>Be well.</p>
<p>Drinks.</p>
<p>Ok so now it's telling me food will drop from sell 15 to 22 so now what we can do is we can go straight to sell 16 cos it's one hire and make sure that actually is a burger now.</p>
<p>No 16 sweat drop from right so make sure that's empty now and it is empty and make sure it's lined up with the other neighbouring cells negative 24.</p>
<p>244 on the y-axis which is then we go down to sell 23 which is actually sell 22 because these again it's one larger then they should legitimately be a burger which it is -346 which is the same height as all of its neighbours the only other thing we need to check is to make sure that the player cells.</p>
<p>The best versions of these cells contain the correct food items as well.</p>
<p>So it was cell.</p>
<p>16 should contain food item negative 1 which is nothing which is correct that is what it says and also just make sure these are all yeah these can't be moved I think these are controlled by grid layout yeah yeah that's good I made sure of that's to make sure that they never move.</p>
<p>Cell number 23 contains food item xero which i'm guessing is the burger that it currently is and we can check that because there we go there's our food items and number 0 certainly is.</p>
<p>So that is working.</p>
<p>Perfectly I wouldn't say perfectly it.</p>
<p>Being a little faster.</p>
<p>So we can we can fuck with some.</p>
<p>Now and see what looks good and now the next part is we need to go and tell it which cells there's a few things we still have to do right we have to tell it all the cells that this needs to apply to all at one saw those car routines can be spun up and it can do it on all of them also like I said sometimes with a v drop it's going to be dropping and dropping and dropping until it reaches the lowest drop point that it can and it won't just drop one space.</p>
<p>This is actually working so good i'm so pleased with this rice so let's.</p>
<p>Make a horizontal match first let's do the pizza slice.</p>
<p>And we're looking for the visual speed of it now.</p>
<p>Where to slot.</p>
<p>Where to slaw.</p>
<p>All right let's try.</p>
<p>I feel like it's going to be like.</p>
<p>50 or something.</p>
<p>Oh that's better.</p>
<p>I would maybe even go a little bit faster than that but not much more.</p>
<p>So i'm going to go with 266.</p>
<p>I think 266 is going to be a nice speed.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>We don't need that debug anymore so now we have a function that drops food one space it hot swaps the food with its.</p>
<p>Get cell write an updates the database and puts everything where it needs to be so we can call this function now on every single cell that it needs to apply to so the first thing we need to do is find all the empty cells.</p>
<p>It's not really find all empty cells which kind of is.</p>
<p>It's finding all food that.</p>
<p>An empty cell bill lloyd.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>Right so let's just take a closer look at our code because there's a few ways we can go about doing this right we already draw matches.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>So we already have.</p>
<p>The colouring process which is why I did this right the calls the cells that are marched turn to like a bright purple and I did that for my own sanity so that I could like know where these things are mapped so we know.</p>
<p>As as we're colouring cells we could be marking the cells above those coloured cells the problem with that is sometimes they won't be a sell above the colouring cell but what we could do is we could mark mathematically wear the colouring cells would be and then anything that's less than 0 we know is redundant.</p>
<p>What do I mean by that what I mean by that is we get rid of this.</p>
<p>Dirty test.</p>
<p>Right so this is this is going to be something else.</p>
<p>So what we what we should do is make a list right so we make a list of get horizontal.</p>
<p>And then we go and do our horizontal match check.</p>
<p>And then we make a list of our vertical matches and blah blah blah so as we make our list of horizontal matches we're going to make a new list of images I want to call this list.</p>
<p>Hair drops.</p>
<p>Cancel drops.</p>
<p>And to make the list of.</p>
<p>Turn on matches.</p>
<p>Ok it doesn't actually find the matches.</p>
<p>But we know we're going to get a list back off that function right with the horizontal matches in them.</p>
<p>Ok so what we could do then.</p>
<p>So go back to creating a list of horizontal drops.</p>
<p>Forage.</p>
<p>Integer.</p>
<p>Get raf.</p>
<p>In h check.</p>
<p>We want to say hedge drops.</p>
<p>Ads.</p>
<p>Get raf.</p>
<p>Minus grid size.</p>
<p>Actually we could be a little bit more sophisticated than that.</p>
<p>So what were essentially saying is for every single cell that comes back as a match sell as part of our matches our horizontal matches we're going to mark the cells above those cells but like I said right if we're matching along the top right here we're gonna be marking sales at bounds that don't exist what you're going to give us errors so it's a combat that we can simply say if the current get ref.</p>
<p>Grid size.</p>
<p>Is greater than negative 1 then go ahead and add.</p>
<p>This cell to a list of cells that we can work with.</p>
<p>Right so what this is essentially doing is it saying hey you got yourself references for the matches.</p>
<p>Indeed valid cells because they are going to be items that need to drop down to fill the gap.</p>
<p>Images.</p>
<p>Have.</p>
<p>Drops.</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>Actually it's not so vertical is different.</p>
<p>Vertical is different.</p>
<p>Yeah vertical is different.</p>
<p>So the reason why vertical is different right is.</p>
<p>For hedge drops.</p>
<p>We're saying hey this drink needs to drop this burger needs to drop these fries need to drop this drink needs to drop and this pizza needs to drop.</p>
<p>It's a lot of drops.</p>
<p>For a horizontal march let's say this was french fries right.</p>
<p>We don't drop.</p>
<p>Anything other than the cop so the only thing we drop at least during the first iteration raise the only thing we drop is the cell above the start index so this here is the start index.</p>
<p>What's different about hair drops is we basically repeat this.</p>
<p>Times the length of the matches.</p>
<p>So we don't need a list.</p>
<p>At all for hatch drops.</p>
<p>Instead what we can do.</p>
<p>I would assume that the vertical matches starts at the start index so what assume that get the matches position zero would be the same as the start index.</p>
<p>So if that is true what we can do is we can say if we check dart count is greater than 0 in other words do we even have any vertical matches right now if so then what we want to do is we want to take our and this is no longer this is no longer hitch drops these are just drops drop indexes so i'm going to call them eye drops cause opticians love doors will call them eye drops apple also likes those as well and instead what we can say is I drops that add.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Add position zero.</p>
<p>Vtech at position zero.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>We want to say get raf.</p>
<p>Is itself.</p>
<p>Find a script size.</p>
<p>And then we can say if.</p>
<p>Get raf.</p>
<p>Is greater than -1 in other words is it a valid sell that actually exists if so then add into eye drops.</p>
<p>Which is an index of remember all we're doing is making a list of cells food items that need to be dropped and instead of using v check now we use get rough.</p>
<p>Sex of the first.</p>
<p>Start of the match and you gotta find that food item if anything exists above it and you get a mark that food item also as a food item that needs to drop one spurs.</p>
<p>Ok so let's test.</p>
<p>If I drops count is greater than 0 in other words if we have any food to drop.</p>
<p>We want to do is we want to say for each.</p>
<p>Integer drop index.</p>
<p>Can eye drops.</p>
<p>We want to start the car routine.</p>
<p>I've dropped food.</p>
<p>Using.</p>
<p>Drop index.</p>
<p>As the cell reference.</p>
<p>And that's what we do.</p>
<p>And now drop food.</p>
<p>What is going to do it's still not going to work 100% because all we've done so far is managed to get anything that needs to be dropped to drop one space the problem with vertical matches don't forget.</p>
<p>Is we need to drop it.</p>
<p>The number of times.</p>
<p>Phone number of space is all deal with that separately one step at a time make sure that's working first.</p>
<p>All right so let's go in.</p>
<p>Make a match if I can find one.</p>
<p>Why can't I find much as I mean I literally tickle in here for me that I got the burgers that's going to be a complicated one alright i'd be amazed if this works first attempt let's go.</p>
<p>Ok we got an error.</p>
<p>Ok so the weird thing is it's dropped.</p>
<p>Sell 7 to target 14 twice and then it came back with an out of range exception.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I have many questions my first question is.</p>
<p>Where is this game free it will be free.</p>
<p>It's typical isn't it it's always bloody problems.</p>
<p>Is youtube chat working or not.</p>
<p>I can't deal with that right now.</p>
<p>It looks like youtube chat is broken or good something else to fix.</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>I love love that ok well you know what I can't like I said I can't deal with that right now.</p>
<p>Ok so my first question is why.</p>
<p>Why did we tell why did we end up with eye drops concerning the same index twice.</p>
<p>Ok for the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to sanity check this list.</p>
<p>Hi kathy yeah I see your message but who's not reading it for whatever reason like I said I can't deal with that right now I really can't debug.log.</p>
<p>Drop index.</p>
<p>My eye drop has 11 in it.</p>
<p>And only 11 in it so that's not right is it.</p>
<p>So 11 is correct I dropped should have 11 12 and 13.</p>
<p>But it only has 11 in it.</p>
<p>Ok so maybe maybe h matches isn't what I think it is.</p>
<p>Maybe it only has the index.</p>
<p>Now you read it out.</p>
<p>No worries.</p>
<p>Ok so maybe h matches only has the start index.</p>
<p>Off the match and not for the length.</p>
<p>While match index is less than h check.com.</p>
<p>In to get length equals last match count.</p>
<p>Add position.</p>
<p>Match index.</p>
<p>There was a while ago when I put this together ok so it would appear that i'm calculating the length of the match within this function here.</p>
<p>So these are only starting coordinates.</p>
<p>Which is why we only get we only get 11.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is we need to do this.</p>
<p>Is match index = 0.</p>
<p>So that should give us the length of the march.</p>
<p>So then we can just set plus one right because it's a horizontal march.</p>
<p>Search shipping it should be heads check.</p>
<p>Ok so it should be hedge check.</p>
<p>Close index.</p>
<p>That should crawl.</p>
<p>Should crawl the grid horizontally and add the.</p>
<p>Length of marches in.</p>
<p>I think it was a while when I put that together ok let me test that.</p>
<p>1415 16.</p>
<p>Ok it's recording the matches yeah.</p>
<p>That is close to what we want so where we went wrong is we said.</p>
<p>Add hatch check 0 plus index which is the now a calculating the march.</p>
<p>But each one also want.</p>
<p>When is the grid size so what we do is we put that in brackets.</p>
<p>And then we say that is minus grid size.</p>
<p>Also we need to make sure we should declare that as an interesting we basically get.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Is mathematical value here.</p>
<p>And then we say.</p>
<p>If get ref.</p>
<p>Is greater than negative 1.</p>
<p>Another word is it a valid cell.</p>
<p>Then I drops adhere.</p>
<p>Get rough rather.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate test right now if it got this right then we are in business.</p>
<p>Mark 891011 and 12 that's exactly what we wanted.</p>
<p>Exactly correct ok so now let's feed that into start the coroutine.</p>
<p>Of the drops and see if it works.</p>
<p>Are the studies drinks.</p>
<p>Oh my god that's only one part of it because obviously now then we need to this is why this is such a bitch then we need to well I guess what we need to do next is it already off right.</p>
<p>So whatever whatever this whatever these addresses were right so there was like 22 23:24 right.</p>
<p>Yeah 22 23:24 so then what we need to do is we need to work our way up the grid and keep going and dropping that food down right obviously because if we created a gap here we now need to drop this food down here this this food down here this food down here and so on and so forth right.</p>
<p>So we're not done.</p>
<p>And it would be better to drop it all at once so that is.</p>
<p>Everything above right well obviously our condition wants to be.</p>
<p>We basically want to keep going right we want we want to basically mark all the food.</p>
<p>Above all of these indices.</p>
<p>Until we hit the negative range.</p>
<p>Right so how do we do that.</p>
<p>Inner loop and what an inner loop is if ever you have a function so now match 3 what we do is we identify.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Basically now we want to grab this and repeat it for all of the rows above.</p>
<p>So this is where we create an outer loop so this is the outer loop that we're about to do and this is the inner loop so you have to make sure you're in a loops right which does the smaller function and you out a loop just basically repeats the inner loop function right for a set number of things so the the key question is what condition drives the outer loop will the condition for this that drives the outer loop is is the cell.</p>
<p>Van - 1 because as long as that sell number is a positive number we can basically keep minus in the grid size until we hit the negative range alright so that that let's us like understand what it is that we're trying to do right.</p>
<p>So what would you what we're trying to do.</p>
<p>That's vtec.</p>
<p>Are we also need to do for v chequers whilst it's a little bit of a bitch.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So there's our inner loop right so this is getting the full length of the match across the horizontal march but we need to go and get all of its vertical neighbours so for that.</p>
<p>What we can do.</p>
<p>Is we want a minus grid size times the number of iterations so we basically need an iterator variable now.</p>
<p>What does that mean well what it means is.</p>
<p>Would you find.</p>
<p>Iteration so what we'll do that what will do is we'll say.</p>
<p>To the cells.</p>
<p>And what we do is we say.</p>
<p>This is kind of tricky.</p>
<p>It's going to increment.</p>
<p>Want to loop right and then that is going to be the multiplier that we apply to the grid size.</p>
<p>But what you always need to do is you always need to ask yourself to what's going to stop this loop from running infinitely.</p>
<p>The our values that are coming back from our final calculation.</p>
<p>In the positives.</p>
<p>Yeah does.</p>
<p>We haven't got the.</p>
<p>I don't think that's here.</p>
<p>I want to so bad.</p>
<p>I don't know I might have watched that.</p>
<p>So what we can say is for each cell how does this change things well what it means is instead of.</p>
<p>Right instead of adding get reference what we want to add is get reference.</p>
<p>Our size multiplier is basically.</p>
<p>Size multiplier equals.</p>
<p>Grid size.</p>
<p>Times our current drop it duration.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>So when we add.</p>
<p>Our reference cell we can say.</p>
<p>Have a good we're adding grid.</p>
<p>What's the size multiplier so the reason why.</p>
<p>That will give us the original addresses of the original cells within its first iteration is because drop iteration starts at zero alright that's why we start counting from zero in programming so essentially we make no adjustments right so then when we traverse one raw up and drop it iteration becomes 1 we are actually I said plus.</p>
<p>I'm wrong sorry it's - cos we're working our way up don't forget the numbers are going smaller right.</p>
<p>So what size condition.</p>
<p>Should be this is really tricky because the the maths we do a further down below which is why this is kind of tricky.</p>
<p>So what we can do is new start I think would be the way to do this right so in new stars would equal h check a position zero.</p>
<p>Minus grid size.</p>
<p>Times drop iteration.</p>
<p>Which becomes the size multiplier right so really we could put that there and say that that's size multiplier.</p>
<p>And then what we want to do is we want to say while.</p>
<p>Can you start is greater than 0.</p>
<p>But we.</p>
<p>Then what we do is we grab this.</p>
<p>Is there innaloo so it must go inside out a loop.</p>
<p>Then we need a driver.</p>
<p>Turn the outer loop.</p>
<p>So the driver for the outer loop in this case is basically our drop it erection is incremented.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>But we're saying while new start is is is 0 so we have to recalculate new start to know whether it's correct or not so are we do is we go and we take our new start and we run its calculation again at the bottom so that when we come back up the top of the loop it doesn't know what new start is that's because I moved it and I meant to pasta what are you doing.</p>
<p>So let's just logic our way through this so what are we doing right we say while index is less than get length.</p>
<p>Driver.</p>
<p>Yes it would.</p>
<p>Controls.</p>
<p>Actually want to be up here.</p>
<p>So basically all of this.</p>
<p>Goes here.</p>
<p>I have so fuck this up by the way.</p>
<p>And that.</p>
<p>Goes up there.</p>
<p>So that becomes our out a loop and then this becomes our in a loop.</p>
<p>Which caused the.</p>
<p>To make sure that makes sense.</p>
<p>Let's make sure that makes sense so let's go through it logically.</p>
<p>What is drop iterations drop it.</p>
<p>Controls.</p>
<p>How many rows we've gone up.</p>
<p>Basically.</p>
<p>That's all that is right so at the beginning we got zero raw so we start from our start position.</p>
<p>Raise we calculate what the size multiplier is going to be the size multiplier is essentially the grid size because we don't know how wide the grid is I made this so it would work on any grid any shape or size so whatever the size the grid is times the number of drop iterations right so basically that's going to be incrementing.</p>
<p>Each time.</p>
<p>Yeah that's something else that we shouldn't put their to be honest.</p>
<p>Because we don't recalculated anywhere.</p>
<p>So that should go.</p>
<p>So that gets recalculated.</p>
<p>Yeah there's a reason why I did this.</p>
<p>Minus our size multiplier.</p>
<p>What size multiplier is grid size right we can declare it as the normal star so what this will basically do is it sets the start to the actual start of the first march but then as we go in and we change this mass and we say new start is 0 - size multiplier.</p>
<p>Essentially we're moving up one raw.</p>
<p>Fuck me this is complicated right.</p>
<p>Doesn't go into the negatives out of bounds basically.</p>
<p>Then we recalculate the size multiplier based on the current iteration.</p>
<p>Then we run out in a loop.</p>
<p>We increment our drop iteration and we recalculate the size multiplier.</p>
<p>Think that's correct.</p>
<p>So what should happen now.</p>
<p>Is as we get our match.</p>
<p>And our food moves down.</p>
<p>Any food that remains above should drop at the same time it should all drop together.</p>
<p>If I did this correctly.</p>
<p>That's a big f.</p>
<p>Ok right.</p>
<p>Do these drinks.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>Come on I know this errors in the console I know this errors in the console but i'm so fucking happy.</p>
<p>That work straight away.</p>
<p>That is so nice.</p>
<p>Wow that was insane and to get that on the first attempt i'm actually quite pleased with myself.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>We got some errors index without so the first error that showed up was index was out of range must be a non-negative value less than the size of the collection online 323 of drop food which is original positions at food square cell number so that would suggest that it's trying to do.</p>
<p>It got I dropped negative 6.</p>
<p>So it didn't stop where it was supposed to stop.</p>
<p>I know why it's because I forgot to include right this was our filter statement here I forgot to include the new size multiplier in the if conditional check that's why.</p>
<p>Ok let's test it now.</p>
<p>It was working there.</p>
<p>No errors.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>That was nuts.</p>
<p>So good about that you wouldn't believe I got i'm feeling about that.</p>
<p>That is not that was not easy.</p>
<p>That was not easy but we did it.</p>
<p>And we didn't get any invalid results that is so nice ok i'm just checking another time because I cannot I can hardly believe that I got that in the first attempt that's actually not.</p>
<p>Ok to be fair it looks like it didn't work but it's because we haven't.</p>
<p>You haven't finished our loops yet.</p>
<p>What happens if you've got two matches.</p>
<p>So the food was told to drop down one space for one match but we haven't.</p>
<p>We haven't managed to do it for a second match yet right because we're doing it one step at a time so it looks like it didn't work but it did because if it didn't work it would have been all right but it just needs to do it one more space because we actually got a second march.</p>
<p>I'm so happy.</p>
<p>Mercedes pizzas.</p>
<p>Yeah it's starting to work as you can see.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>And as you can see that would have made a new match here as well right so you know.</p>
<p>So we haven't gotten that far where we then check it again for another match and sign and so forth.</p>
<p>The thing i'm worried about is that double that double lead match on the two roars.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised that didn't work because that would suggest that the additional march.</p>
<p>When it matches more than one at a time is it including.</p>
<p>It's not being included in that.</p>
<p>Which means that chords either running elsewhere from a different function which means this is going to need to be implemented in that function too which is a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>I don't know the some other weird reason why it didn't do it on the additional march.</p>
<p>You're not sure.</p>
<p>Ok does it looks like it doesn't work a second time around.</p>
<p>Which is weird.</p>
<p>As well.</p>
<p>How to fix that.</p>
<p>In my pictures that might be because there aren't supposed to be any empty food squares that could just be because the empty food squires are throwing it off.</p>
<p>Hopefully.</p>
<p>I'm trying to make another cos we've only really done this on h much so far we haven't really got as far as v matches match.</p>
<p>Yeah we get it we get an error okay let me try let me see what that is.</p>
<p>So do 1h match let's clear the debug because I want to see exactly what's happening.</p>
<p>What even is that.</p>
<p>Update board.</p>
<p>Oh yeah it's probably yes it is it's the empty yes that's good I know it's weird to celebrate an hour but the reason i'm celebrating that errors because yes that error is it's because food square minus one is impossible but food square minus 1 tells me that there's no food in that square.</p>
<p>Which the games the game is meant to ever handle that because it's there's always supposed to be food in these squares so that's fine that's a good error to have because you know once once once we finish with this we're going to replenish the food so there's always going to be food in those squares.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>So one step closer.</p>
<p>I can still barely believe i'm so pleased with that this is such a hard project to work on I can't believe how difficult this has been.</p>
<p>This is really challenged me this.</p>
<p>Yeah so in this situation.</p>
<p>Log.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell let's just comment it out though.</p>
<p>Servicing now the next thing we would do is well there's a few things we need.</p>
<p>But for that specific test while i'm just testing hitch matches the next thing we need to basically do is replenish the food now.</p>
<p>Replenish the food in the square above in the squares that are now empty above.</p>
<p>The more I think about this the more of a pain in the ass that says as well because.</p>
<p>Creating illusions in games is always harder than doing things in reality.</p>
<p>What I mean by that is.</p>
<p>In hindsight I wish i'd made an invisible raw that the player doesn't see the already has food in it.</p>
<p>Waiting to drop down to the next raw because that would make my life easier as a developer.</p>
<p>Because otherwise so.</p>
<p>I want this to work.</p>
<p>Do I want this to work is when the food gets generated I don't want to just pop it into the squares because it's going to look weird.</p>
<p>Because if everything from here.</p>
<p>Removed down to hear one space.</p>
<p>How many weeks could just like as long as we delay we don't do it the same time we could just make food appear in these squares I guess.</p>
<p>But how I prefer it works is we generate the food.</p>
<p>In a non-existent square above here and we drop it in and then i'd need to go a step further so here's what i'd like to achieve.</p>
<p>When we generate the new food and we drop it in a.</p>
<p>And we do an animation that drops the food in a place then we actually fill the squares with the food that it's supposed to be and what i'd also need to do is implement what's called a mask here and what a mask will do.</p>
<p>It will essentially.</p>
<p>Draw over the top the background over the top.</p>
<p>What are essentially means is.</p>
<p>Play will only see the food appear behind.</p>
<p>The grid so looks so if you think about it right it doesn't look like the food's falling from the sky it looks like the foods.</p>
<p>If you imagine that this thing.</p>
<p>Alarm for infinity and the things just moving down constantly from within itself.</p>
<p>That's basically what it should look like.</p>
<p>If I do this is going to do a v match as well doesn't it's gonna look weird.</p>
<p>Yeah it is working I think it's when I click the button to do another move that's when everything fell apart but that makes sense cuz these these squares are actually supposed to be empty.</p>
<p>Are there right now but.</p>
<p>It's finished it's not meant to end up like that.</p>
<p>Ok so what now.</p>
<p>Well we need to make sure the.</p>
<p>Check the vertical matches work right.</p>
<p>No rest for the wicked nola ok so we need to make sure the vertical matches work so what happens currently when we make a vertical march.</p>
<p>We get an error.</p>
<p>Ok what area do we get.</p>
<p>Line 226.</p>
<p>Get length equals last match count at position zero.</p>
<p>I guess because we didn't have any horizontal matches.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>Ok I think I know how to fix this.</p>
<p>Yeah we might not always have horizontal matches so.</p>
<p>I guess what we could do is we could just encapsulate all this and say if.</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>Count is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Add only then do we do all of this.</p>
<p>But now we've lost our eye drops reference.</p>
<p>That's ok.</p>
<p>We just declare the eye drops list outside of that.</p>
<p>Encapsulation.</p>
<p>How much is still works perfectly good good sign yeah probably will back us up there and what if we make a v match.</p>
<p>What if we make a v match let's do this pizza.</p>
<p>Yeah I mean that that's fine but what we need to do.</p>
<p>Is the same thing that we did before right so now we've got to do the.</p>
<p>That we did before on the h matches and go and get all the food above and making out a loop for it.</p>
<p>And move those down but we also need to repeat this process until.</p>
<p>We've done it the same times as the length of the march.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Before so we'll run the we'll run.</p>
<p>Then we go in and we do our it's not even really a loop.</p>
<p>We just add the initial.</p>
<p>So this just gives us the initial reference.</p>
<p>The starting point as it were.</p>
<p>Ok so what we can do is we can say.</p>
<p>Will get raf is the start point reyes.</p>
<p>Get reference to start playing so what we can do is we can say.</p>
<p>Again it's iterations really.</p>
<p>It should already be greater than -1.</p>
<p>Ok I think that should be it.</p>
<p>We're not done.</p>
<p>Don't get too happy.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Ok so what I was going to do.</p>
<p>Is I was going to say.</p>
<p>Can I record.</p>
<p>How do I draw how do I clear this.</p>
<p>Cancel horrible ears.</p>
<p>How do you get a filled square.</p>
<p>I can't use fucking pen I have no idea how to use it.</p>
<p>I used to like I thought paint used to be good but I feel like they're just like made it convolute and like shit like I really had the new paint I need to shut.</p>
<p>What I was going to do I use this as an example.</p>
<p>I was going to I was going to say.</p>
<p>Whatever the length is of the v match right so let's say the v match was the length of 3 here.</p>
<p>I was going to say while basically loop it for the length of the match right so for each length keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it and then you'll reach bottom.</p>
<p>The problem is.</p>
<p>The way i've done this I can't do that.</p>
<p>Because i've been using eye drops to store cell references.</p>
<p>Needs to be dropped but I haven't.</p>
<p>Separated horizontal cell references from vertical cell references so we don't know from those cell numbers whether they are horizontal matches or vertical matches.</p>
<p>So unless I change it somehow so that we do separate the two.</p>
<p>I'm going to need another way of doing this so probably the probably a better way of doing this is to let it come out of the car routine.</p>
<p>We can make it part of the drop food.</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>So like we were doing with our other thing right we make a target salary or cell number plus grid size.</p>
<p>I get sell.</p>
<p>So again what we could do is we could put an iteration on that.</p>
<p>So we can declare an iteration at the top and market is 0 then we could say it's grid size x iteration.</p>
<p>And then what we could do is we could say.</p>
<p>That's a global.</p>
<p>We could say while.</p>
<p>Filipino match we basically drop.</p>
<p>While the target cell the cell below.</p>
<p>Is empty so what we could do is we could say food squares.</p>
<p>Get components.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>Target cell.</p>
<p>Get components.</p>
<p>Raw image.</p>
<p>Texture.</p>
<p>Is empty texture.</p>
<p>And then we need to make sure we recalculate the target cell at the bottom and we increment iteration so it's already been declared so we take the declaration hours.</p>
<p>Are we make sure we increment iteration fast.</p>
<p>And essentially that should control the outer loop.</p>
<p>How to loop is basically saying.</p>
<p>While the cell beneath you that you are trying to drop into is empty.</p>
<p>Doing this.</p>
<p>So we need a conditional check for that.</p>
<p>So we can move this.</p>
<p>Into that.</p>
<p>Outlook.</p>
<p>But we're going to get an error.</p>
<p>When it goes out of range.</p>
<p>So what we'll do is we'll declare.</p>
<p>A bull.</p>
<p>Call in range which was set to true.</p>
<p>And then we can simply do a calculation.</p>
<p>That says.</p>
<p>When is the council app.</p>
<p>Been doing with percents.</p>
<p>Am I asking actually.</p>
<p>I think you use a percent.</p>
<p>A percent signed to do.</p>
<p>Men function to limit the maximum value this way the target cell will never exceed the final cell index so it's not using the percent sign.</p>
<p>Equals mathf dot men target cell.</p>
<p>Within the range of max cell index.</p>
<p>That's fun.</p>
<p>I'm learning better ways to do things.</p>
<p>So if we exceeded like.</p>
<p>Targeting but it's tricky and something like this because we do an initial calculation to do the initial drop right.</p>
<p>I'm being an idiot.</p>
<p>Yeah this this I am being an idiot this can't go out of range because the food drops.</p>
<p>I still want to this is still a good practice anyway I think.</p>
<p>Right so then we can change our target cell calculation to that one there as well and it just makes sure that it stays within the cell range.</p>
<p>Yeah I like that.</p>
<p>V drops.</p>
<p>Nice about this right is if we make multiple matches so remember before when I when I got two horizontal matches.</p>
<p>French fries.</p>
<p>Thank you for that pc boo.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Ok we need to know what's going wrong.</p>
<p>Did it also break h matches.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes I need to pack it up actually.</p>
<p>So thinks it's dropping this is why it's not working it thinks it's got a drop food from 22 to 22 so in other words it's not going to move it and it's going to drop food from 23 to 23:24 to 24 so it's not it's not going to sell down is it.</p>
<p>Arkansas iteration starts at zero that's why.</p>
<p>Start at 1 that's why.</p>
<p>That's why.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Because of the way.</p>
<p>So received the instructions correctly to do everything but what seems to be stopping it now.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I'm being an idiot we don't always we don't always have to drop into an empty slot.</p>
<p>This is only true a v food.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be empty.</p>
<p>The food needs to be empty.</p>
<p>It should do the thing anywhere oh this is really tricky.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Ok what i'm going to do to fix this is i'm going to say while iteration is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Rather than try to control.</p>
<p>Because we can't control this by texture I don't know how the fuck i'm going to do this to be honest.</p>
<p>What we can instead do is we can say.</p>
<p>Let me think about this.</p>
<p>Four h matches it only drops down one space but we also came across the situation where we got two heads matches on top of like next to each other.</p>
<p>Right you can do that like that that can happen because if you if you have a pizza a pizza a burger and a burger.</p>
<p>And you have a burger here in a.</p>
<p>I like the other words you you swap them around you make too much threes on both roads at the same time it's not that uncommon really.</p>
<p>I have no idea.</p>
<p>I'm doing this right now.</p>
<p>So naked but in that case would we wouldn't drop the food down or what yeah we would need to drop the food down because we create too much is then we create then we'd get rid of all of this food and with time on so it would scan two roars.</p>
<p>I don't know if there's any way to do this.</p>
<p>Without separating.</p>
<p>How much is from v matches I think maybe we need we need hatch drops and v drops.</p>
<p>I don't know that we can drop all the food as the same type of food.</p>
<p>Silence is great for me right now cos I need all the brand power I can get.</p>
<p>I mean there's good news in this bad news the good news is like seeing how that works there it shows that I can get the effect that I want.</p>
<p>Like I can make food drop.</p>
<p>Further and further down.</p>
<p>As it needs to.</p>
<p>That's the good news.</p>
<p>Do you think I want that right now.</p>
<p>If.</p>
<p>Food squares.</p>
<p>Add target cell.</p>
<p>Well i'm not going to how am I going to remember that.</p>
<p>Do you not have me I don't is this a your account already friends on a you anyway I thought I already have you on that i'll have a we can have a look at that when i'm in genshin letter but right now I really need to concentrate on this.</p>
<p>Food squares target sell get components.</p>
<p>Raw image.</p>
<p>Dot texture.</p>
<p>Equals equals empty text.</p>
<p>Iteration.</p>
<p>What's 0.</p>
<p>Else.</p>
<p>We're starting a new one.</p>
<p>Why would you do that.</p>
<p>Else iteration increments ok let me try that so essentially what I think i'm trying to say here is ok drop into your respective position.</p>
<p>Then do a check when you reach the bottom and you do the final swap and if the cell below you although I think tag itself will be looking at the same cell.</p>
<p>But i'm not sure where the target sell will actually be.</p>
<p>The old target cell ok it might be that it's the old target cell.</p>
<p>So then I guess it would be target sell plus.</p>
<p>Red size so first we would need to declare that as an integer.</p>
<p>So get below equals target cell plus grid size.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>The qualify here is if.</p>
<p>Get below.</p>
<p>Is less than.</p>
<p>Max sell index.</p>
<p>Then if food squares.</p>
<p>Add target cell.</p>
<p>But then we change target cell.</p>
<p>I think we just then then here we just said target cell equals get below.</p>
<p>Actually I think it's the other way around.</p>
<p>I think it's I think it's iteration increment here and iteration equals 0 it's so hard to concentrate when there's light destruction.</p>
<p>Ok I seems to be starting to work we got a lot of hours though.</p>
<p>Ok so what is the argument out of range exception that we get.</p>
<p>Will iteration is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Target position is food squares target sell rex transform local position.</p>
<p>So maybe we didn't need to change target cell to get below.</p>
<p>Maybe target sell wants to go back to this.</p>
<p>Let's try that.</p>
<p>Yay ok so far so good.</p>
<p>Empty squares before I can do that.</p>
<p>Nothing much.</p>
<p>Ok that was kind of weird.</p>
<p>Not 100% right.</p>
<p>First of all I wasn't expecting to get the that's a bit too much of an intense test for it right now.</p>
<p>It did a horizontal march on a vertical match at the same time which like let's just chill the fuck out I didn't mean to do that let's just do one v match first.</p>
<p>Again fuck you it's doing just give me one normal v match.</p>
<p>Is all I need.</p>
<p>Yeah that's not working properly.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>This is so difficult the reason it's difficult is because.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing whether the match was made horizontally or vertically and I think there's two no two ways about it.</p>
<p>I think I need to to change the way this works.</p>
<p>So here's what I think I need to do.</p>
<p>Let's let's work backwards.</p>
<p>Let's work from the result that we want and then make it work up the chair right so essentially.</p>
<p>Length.</p>
<p>Length is fine.</p>
<p>Are distance or something well lengths length like the length being how many times.</p>
<p>Are we dropping this.</p>
<p>While iterations.</p>
<p>Will iterations is less than length.</p>
<p>It means we're going to need to separate these are I can't really think of any other way to do it so forget all of this.</p>
<p>I kind of want.</p>
<p>Do this but I want to do get above.</p>
<p>What I kind of want to do is instead of making the food empty I don't think it's a bad thing but instead of making the food empty which is what we do here let's be a little bit more sophisticated with a so what we can do is we can do a calculation here where we'll say get above.</p>
<p>Rather than just make the cell empty.</p>
<p>So we do a swap down we should do a swap up as basically what i'm saying so we want to take the target cell and we want to make it.</p>
<p>Make it sell minus grid size it's not even target cell.</p>
<p>See the other issue with this right is we take a cell number.</p>
<p>And during our loop we can't do cell number anymore either.</p>
<p>Actually yeah that might have been why it wasn't working just give me a second.</p>
<p>Our motherfucker let's I need to back this up.</p>
<p>I just realised something.</p>
<p>Go back to before I put length in.</p>
<p>What college plan b.</p>
<p>Yeah what I actually noticed.</p>
<p>Just now so save that let's go and back this up.</p>
<p>Because it's sort of working right so.</p>
<p>There's always there's always a chance that I might end up breaking it more than I end up.</p>
<p>Improving it.</p>
<p>Yeah the problem is why we do while we do multiple iterations as well although did seem to drop the food further down which is kind of weird.</p>
<p>So here's what's weird right is.</p>
<p>If we look at our chord.</p>
<p>Take a cell number but the cell number is really just the initial cell number because if we're expanding this function out to drop further than one square which is what it was originally.</p>
<p>We can't keep doing it in the loop on the original cell number because the original cell isn't the same cell that it was when it comes out of the loop as when it went into the loop because the whole point of this chord is it basically says hey sell you're going to become this you're going to put you're going to put your right I mean here and this is going to become you and then you're going to become blank what I also want to do now is actually you're going to become this thing here.</p>
<p>Software running down on a loop.</p>
<p>First it drops itself as a pizza slice then it drops itself as a drink then it drops itself as a burger yeah getting I guess that is I guess doing it on the samsung.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>I was thinking of need to go I need to move down because the food moved down right so the cell that gets the cord.</p>
<p>The dent traverse down one cell on its next iteration.</p>
<p>But not necessarily because it does seem to be doing that correctly.</p>
<p>Play if we do the matches.</p>
<p>But if we take that iteration counter out.</p>
<p>Like we are able we are able to drop this food down multiple times as we've seen and it seems to work.</p>
<p>Empty cells.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know though because it's just.</p>
<p>So I do wonder if we should be targeting the next cell down.</p>
<p>During our loop.</p>
<p>Let's run through this logically.</p>
<p>So I am this burger.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I am this burger and I get 12 hey burger.</p>
<p>Let's say i'm a v match.</p>
<p>Let's say my destination is here.</p>
<p>And i'm supposed to go here on my first iteration I is the burger move down here I give this cell.</p>
<p>My burger and then I jump back up to the top and I empty myself essentially.</p>
<p>On the 2nd iteration.</p>
<p>Whatever whatever is in me is it also going to drop down one space.</p>
<p>I guess I guess I don't I think I think I don't need to change cell number and the reason why is because I already passed my contents to the cell below.</p>
<p>I already passed my contents to the cell below.</p>
<p>You know when i'm done so i'm no longer the same cell that I was when I started so essentially we kind of are different cell but we're also kind of not it's kind of weird.</p>
<p>I guess I could also just count the length that I need to drop.</p>
<p>But that's kind of what I was trying to do right I was trying to say look.</p>
<p>By the time you return back to your original position.</p>
<p>We are now another cell check to see if the cell below you is.</p>
<p>But unless we were empty on the previous iteration there's no way the cell beneath is will ever be empty.</p>
<p>So what that means is the empty cells and get it like the empty cells and getting filled from cell number.</p>
<p>They're getting filled from a cell above it that's.</p>
<p>Instruction to drop its food into you right.</p>
<p>So checking to see whether the cell below you is empty or not is kind of irrelevant at the end of the run.</p>
<p>I like he's about to become empty right and you need to fill that gap.</p>
<p>Complicated.</p>
<p>Am I asked chachi bt if it can share some light on this for me cuz i'm genuinely.</p>
<p>Struggling.</p>
<p>The only other way I can think of to do this is when we first when we first run this car routine.</p>
<p>Is the first thing we do is.</p>
<p>We look at each cell.</p>
<p>Underneath us and we can't how many empty cells there are.</p>
<p>So essentially what we could do is.</p>
<p>So we set iterations to one right.</p>
<p>And then we could say in here for example we could say.</p>
<p>Next cell equals cell number + grid size rice.</p>
<p>And then we can say while next sale is less than we need to max sell index first.</p>
<p>Max cell index.</p>
<p>Next song equals.</p>
<p>Cell number plus grid size.</p>
<p>Times iterations.</p>
<p>And we increment iterations.</p>
<p>So essentially.</p>
<p>Whilst there are still sells to traverse vertically traverse the cells vertically and add a new iteration but this is we don't want to we don't want to add an iteration for no reason we only want to add an iteration if the cell in question is empty so I guess our logic would be if.</p>
<p>Squares.</p>
<p>Add position next cell.</p>
<p>Don't get compliance.</p>
<p>Draw image.</p>
<p>Texture.</p>
<p>Pause empty texture.</p>
<p>10 increment iterations essentially what we're saying is.</p>
<p>Count how many empty squares of beneath you and for each empty square beneath you.</p>
<p>Add a valid cell.</p>
<p>Add one more iteration to your drop.</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>Because we need it one.</p>
<p>Here's why that won't work.</p>
<p>We need one iteration.</p>
<p>Fucking hell i've got a better idea.</p>
<p>Set it set me directions to zero.</p>
<p>That will make that work for empty squares the problem is it will be 0 for the food that is dropping to replace other food so here we could say if iterations remains zero then set iterations to one because you still you're still you're still being instructed to drop down and swap with the food beneath.</p>
<p>Iterations that were will always be at least one.</p>
<p>At least this way I would think we can at least successfully.</p>
<p>And then we said while.</p>
<p>Put here this is like how many iterations are we doing.</p>
<p>So we would need to do like in index equals 0 while index is less than iterations.</p>
<p>Increment index.</p>
<p>Let's see what that does.</p>
<p>It was going so well.</p>
<p>Until it wasn't.</p>
<p>What the hell was that.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Do you think I can explain it in words.</p>
<p>That's the problem I can barely explain it never mind understand it and debug it.</p>
<p>The island of course I understand what i'm trying to do it's just in terms of code I have no idea how the fuck i'm actually going to do it it seems like it seems like this should work though I feel like i'm on the right track but i'm just like.</p>
<p>Failing to get the syntax correct to do what it is that i'm trying to do.</p>
<p>Let's just see what chachi pt.</p>
<p>Suggests.</p>
<p>Did she seems to stem from a combination of logic errors in your loop the condition checks on how the cells are being updated during the drop operation let's break down the issues and correct them.</p>
<p>Let's just try your cord and see what it does how about that.</p>
<p>How about we just do that.</p>
<p>I think i'm over it.</p>
<p>You broke my you broke my food above logic.</p>
<p>Chachi bbc broke everything.</p>
<p>So here's the funny thing about it right I feel like.</p>
<p>So I solved the problem of not being able to make the food above drop.</p>
<p>Chachi bt looks like it's almost solved the problem of making the food drop further when it needs to drop further but it broke the food above drop it's like if we could just get both of those things to work.</p>
<p>Do we need why is it going off to the side that's so funny it is actually dropping down there.</p>
<p>So it does seem like like chachi pt has managed to.</p>
<p>Specifically.</p>
<p>Almost solve the problem of the food dropping.</p>
<p>The extra amount of times that it needs to drop.</p>
<p>Yeah it's also it's also saying no need to drop if not empty cells below ok.</p>
<p>Let me explain that to it ok.</p>
<p>Yes food drops further now.</p>
<p>But then.</p>
<p>Moves off to the side.</p>
<p>Also food.</p>
<p>Should drop.</p>
<p>Also only.</p>
<p>Food drops into empty squares now.</p>
<p>Put all the food stacked.</p>
<p>Add both will also drop.</p>
<p>Unto cells with other food.</p>
<p>Which this new quad brakes.</p>
<p>Yes food drops further now but then moves off to the side also only food drops into empty.</p>
<p>Turn all the food stacked above will also drop on the cells with other food which discord breaks thank you for clarification let's address both of these issues movement off to the side the movement issue likely comes from an incorrect local position up there.</p>
<p>Ring stacked food if the food above the match cells also needs to drop into the.</p>
<p>Specifically we need to ensure that the entire stack of food above empty cells drops correctly.</p>
<p>Yeah but don't think that this chord wants to grab that food above because it doesn't I already send.</p>
<p>I already send.</p>
<p>Is this function gets the correct cells of food that it needs to drop 100%.</p>
<p>Set doesn't need to now the food moves up what the fuck is going on there ok it's completely butchering the fuck out of this it is completely butchering the fuck out of this.</p>
<p>I think I might need to go back to.</p>
<p>The version I was starting to flesh out a moment ago where I gave it an additional lengths value.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>That is so true.</p>
<p>Jesus christ i've tried so many different versions of this that i'm like i'm genuinely confused about what this version even does.</p>
<p>The last successful change we made.</p>
<p>Was.</p>
<p>Grabbing the above food something went wrong with the pizza slice there.</p>
<p>I feel like the best version of this we had.</p>
<p>What's the genuinely before I started trying to loop it.</p>
<p>And look ahead.</p>
<p>I'm back.</p>
<p>Weather come from.</p>
<p>Right before I created the iteration variable.</p>
<p>We only do it if the food squares texture is empty.</p>
<p>This is going back very far from before I tried to loop it I remember the one thing I felt good about.</p>
<p>The last thing I felt good about is we did this this felt great I love that i've managed to get that to work that's really.</p>
<p>Go and find all the food above and drop that down.</p>
<p>And then I did the same thing to the verticals.</p>
<p>I managed to get the verticals yet and drop it down but it only drops down one square right this is where i'm going to back it up again this is the best version of it that i've managed to achieve.</p>
<p>You know what I might have over thought it.</p>
<p>Basically we should drop down one cell right and then at the end.</p>
<p>Just i've got it.</p>
<p>Is there any one thing it's not doing and that's the thing the only thing it's not doing is it's not dropping additional places.</p>
<p>When it needs to but I think I am overthinking it right because we already have the function.</p>
<p>Already have the coroutine for dropping food right which is called drop food so surely when i've dropped the food down all I need to do is.</p>
<p>Target right.</p>
<p>Next target.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Target cell.</p>
<p>Plus grade size.</p>
<p>Let me just think about this.</p>
<p>Does target sellers is where the where the thing is that we dropped.</p>
<p>Now we need to go one further down and see if that's empty.</p>
<p>You can say.</p>
<p>First of all we need to make sure next target is within the range right.</p>
<p>Max sell.</p>
<p>Call cell size.</p>
<p>Grid size.</p>
<p>Times grid size.</p>
<p>-1.</p>
<p>Target is less than max sell.</p>
<p>Then check to see.</p>
<p>If that cell is empty.</p>
<p>So you can say.</p>
<p>Grid cells.</p>
<p>Add position next target.</p>
<p>Dark food item.</p>
<p>Is -1 which is empty.</p>
<p>Then essentially we can start a quarantine.</p>
<p>Is spin up another version of this function.</p>
<p>And the cell we want to give it.</p>
<p>Isn't.</p>
<p>Next target I think it's target sale.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Can I need another one I need to I can wipe.</p>
<p>Right because this this is cell ref that comes in this is cell ref this.</p>
<p>Is target sell and this is next target.</p>
<p>We finished dropping our food so burger now is here we're still running on this cell though so now we know that that's the burger there's no point looking at that so that's why we look at this salary is this cell still empty if so we want to drop yeah target cell.</p>
<p>The cell below which is target sell.</p>
<p>One space down and rinse and repeat the process of course I could just spin up another quarantine right we just we rinse and repeat rather than trying to do it in a loop we just spin up another coroutine and then it'll apply all its logic again I think i've been overthinking the shit out of this.</p>
<p>I think that'll do it.</p>
<p>Hey it didn't it didn't break that's the main thing I didn't break it also didn't do what I was trying to do but it didn't break.</p>
<p>Where the first thing I need to check.</p>
<p>Is this is the speed even being applied right are we even are we even reaching this condition.</p>
<p>Are michael crevices draw i've got something in the fridge.</p>
<p>Yeah so the condition is being reached.</p>
<p>Are we need to know what sells we need to know what cells it was checking on so what what we should have done there.</p>
<p>What we should have done there is we should have.</p>
<p>We should have checked these empty cells here.</p>
<p>Let's let's bring the numbers on let's bring the numbers back.</p>
<p>And will say what sell we're checking right.</p>
<p>So we'll say checking.</p>
<p>If cell is empty and we'll say which sell we're checking rate.</p>
<p>Next target.</p>
<p>Did sammy good news the reason it's sammy good news is.</p>
<p>We are hitting that condition.</p>
<p>Ok so the pizza slice right.</p>
<p>Right so we should be checking 38.</p>
<p>Which we do to see if it's empty and if cell 38 is empty we were supposed to tell sell 31 a drop down again.</p>
<p>I just realised we got another issue with this though.</p>
<p>If we do that.</p>
<p>What about all the food above.</p>
<p>One step at a time.</p>
<p>17.</p>
<p>Yeah because.</p>
<p>So did we not do this.</p>
<p>I don't know what is happening.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>That would suggest wait a minute so maybe my condition maybe we found a new bug.</p>
<p>Is visually.</p>
<p>Visually.</p>
<p>You can see the 32.</p>
<p>What is 2b empty but what if.</p>
<p>Loan behold.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Now we know why it's not working.</p>
<p>Sell 32 appears to be empty.</p>
<p>If 30.</p>
<p>32 became empty then the code must have run on 32.</p>
<p>Ok this is where we need to do it.</p>
<p>Greek squares.</p>
<p>Sell square.</p>
<p>Oh my god what the fuck is it called what is place owls.</p>
<p>Why don't I name these things so I know what they are.</p>
<p>There's an idea.</p>
<p>Dread cells I swear I looked for that.</p>
<p>No apparently I didn't grid cells.</p>
<p>Add positions start index.</p>
<p>Was iteration index.</p>
<p>Does food item equals negative 1.</p>
<p>So we weren't emptying the fucking cells from the database perspective gee I wonder why it hasn't been working I can't imagine why it hasn't been working.</p>
<p>I just want this to be over now.</p>
<p>Ok we can't test.</p>
<p>We can't test it until we refill the empty squares multiple times so we have to do it on one run per for now.</p>
<p>There we go the burger dropped all the way to the bottom now the issue is.</p>
<p>We need the food above to do the same.</p>
<p>Managed I managed to get the food to drop to the bottom by recalling the coroutine when the cell below is empty how can I check the cells above to see if they contain food.</p>
<p>Can we add doors so they also drop to.</p>
<p>Ok we'll see if this works.</p>
<p>Almost worked.</p>
<p>To avoid the index out of range when trying to access food type.</p>
<p>When food item is negative 1 you should add a conditional check before trying to set the texture.</p>
<p>The food item -1 signifies that the cell is empty so you shouldn't attempt.</p>
<p>In that case.</p>
<p>So this replaces that line there I believe.</p>
<p>Will the good news is we got nervous.</p>
<p>All the food fucking disappeared.</p>
<p>It's just deleting food now.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I feel like i'm so bad at this I feel like I should force myself to make match 3 games.</p>
<p>For the next 5 years until I get good at this cos like i'm sure like they're probably people out there who are like oh yeah yeah you just do this and this and this and this and they're just like they're just fucking.</p>
<p>This is absolutely.</p>
<p>That's what it is basically.</p>
<p>We were grabbing the food above.</p>
<p>What I should be doing instead here is saying.</p>
<p>This is a bit we need to replace so this just assumes that the cell is going to be empty right but instead what I need to do is I need to say integer.</p>
<p>Sell above.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Cell number -.</p>
<p>Grid size.</p>
<p>If sullivan.</p>
<p>Else.</p>
<p>We make it.</p>
<p>We make it empty.</p>
<p>Unless there is actually something in the cell above if there's something in the cell above.</p>
<p>Then we get the food item from grid cells.</p>
<p>Sell above.</p>
<p>Food item.</p>
<p>And then the texture is.</p>
<p>Food items.</p>
<p>Food item.</p>
<p>And then that number there.</p>
<p>Types.</p>
<p>Mini games right no matter how boring they may have seen.</p>
<p>I couldn't do it.</p>
<p>Every single aspect of it right.</p>
<p>They do in such a short time as well like if you said to me.</p>
<p>Ok your job.</p>
<p>To make the next genshin impact mini-game right we want to match 3 mini game and you've got like how long do they get.</p>
<p>20 days to do it in.</p>
<p>I would be like oh no.</p>
<p>Only 20 days.</p>
<p>Everything everything is broken.</p>
<p>Beyond repair.</p>
<p>I don't.</p>
<p>Walking on the stands.</p>
<p>I suppose it's always.</p>
<p>Going to keep traversing up the right.</p>
<p>Like it looks like it's trying to work.</p>
<p>Yeah they actually this might be a bad idea right because if this is happening to the cells above us anywhere which it is then maybe we shouldn't be trying to write yeah remember we shouldn't do this at all actually.</p>
<p>I cannot get my brain around this because there's so many problems with this right because like i'm thinking okay so I just realised another problem with this right.</p>
<p>Play so what i'm doing it seems so simple but it's just not i'm saying you're a french fry it seems so simple drop down to the pizza slice.</p>
<p>Replace the pizza slice with the french fry that you were jump back up to the top and now i'm saying go and get whatever is above you and replace yourself with whatever is above you the problem with that is this thing is running on every single piece of script on every single cell right so this cell is also being told hey you are whatever the freak you are you an empty cell you're going to move down to this french fry and replace this french fry with what you are so we don't want to write up and down we only want to write in one direction so the problem which is how it was originally working right but the problem with that is if i'm at the top and i'm a french fry right and i'm told you're going to go and replace this french fry with your french fry because it's a french fry anywhere probably a bad example there but whatever and then you got to jump up back up to the top.</p>
<p>Yourself blank because if nothing if nothing above you.</p>
<p>Cayman overall.</p>
<p>Script maybe I need a call routine manager for this as well because we need to make sure that the cells run in the correct order.</p>
<p>Now we can check that with debug to be honest.</p>
<p>I like everything I just added which seemed like really smart.</p>
<p>Will actually just break it.</p>
<p>Because it's running on every cell.</p>
<p>Every cell is going to be like getting confused about what it is cos 1 minute it's a french fry the next minute it's the thing above it which is now a fucking burger and it wasn't fucking french fry but it was supposed to be a french fry but the french fry replace itself with the fucking burger when it went you see what i'm saying it's like it's absolute chaos absolute chaos so.</p>
<p>When we set them to blank right which is what does originally was.</p>
<p>That was good for the top cells the reason it was good for the top cells is because then the food drops down.</p>
<p>Let's demonstrate it here see now it's blank now that's correct it should be.</p>
<p>But what that seems to be doing it's fine for horizontal matches I think not even horizontal matches are broken now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Vertical match give me a vertical match give me a vertical match what to do with vertical matches.</p>
<p>Slices in burgers and drinks what the.</p>
<p>Let me make I use new dress i'd rather fucking make a new dress jesus.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>What do I even do with that what what even happens does anybody even know what just happened because I don't.</p>
<p>Well no I think I do and this is what i'm saying right this is this is replacing it with empty textures so now it's just getting eaten up right it's just getting everything is becoming blank because it's running it it's running it's running it's running and then it keeps saying oh I guess i'm blank now or I guess i'm blank now oh I guess i'm blank now well you're not fucking blank because you must be the thing that was above you but if I said that you're the thing that was above you well first of all what are these guys do because there's nothing above them and then secondly.</p>
<p>So maybe we need when maybe we need a mixture of that right.</p>
<p>I believe I believe I believe this needs to be an if statement I believe what this should say is what we were saying before.</p>
<p>Is gone get the food above you.</p>
<p>No I can't do that because the.</p>
<p>Right let's make sure that these cells of the first thing I need to know before I go any further is these cells have to be going up the grid they have to if this code runs in the wrong order if it if it runs down the grid with fucked it has to run up the grid because if it doesn't run up the grid things are going to override each other.</p>
<p>Ok that is a lot of.</p>
<p>So let's see we want to see give me the numbers.</p>
<p>Give me the numbers right.</p>
<p>Show me the numbers make it nice ok there.</p>
<p>Okay so first of all we got sell 23 which is here then we got sells 16 ok the good news is it's going up the grid the bad news is it's also going down the grid.</p>
<p>I guess because wayne capsules.</p>
<p>All of the food above rice we get the stack above and we also do the routine on that as well so that that drops down one square but now in our infinite wisdom if we need to drop more places we're calling the new coroutine so we're adding to the queue.</p>
<p>Who is starting at 37.</p>
<p>And then we're doing 23 and then we're doing 16 and then we're doing 9.</p>
<p>This is all over the place then we're doing 16 then we're doing now and then we're doing now i'm looking at target god damn it ok let's just make sure i'm looking at the right.</p>
<p>So we're doing 23.</p>
<p>Can we do in 16 and we're doing 9.</p>
<p>2316 and 9.</p>
<p>Yeah sure I guess.</p>
<p>Mary I don't know then we do two so we go all the way to the top then these will be the newly these are probably the repeat of coroutines that I like all you need to go further so then it does 30.</p>

<p>Skip 23.</p>
<p>I have no idea why it's skip 23.</p>
<p>I guess 2023 didn't meet the conditions to get another coroutine off.</p>
<p>Will a checking food item to be.</p>
<p>Greater than -1.</p>
<p>Oh he's not.</p>
<p>He's not showing anymore as he is dead.</p>
<p>Assistance activated false let me just test that.</p>
<p>He's becoming true.</p>
<p>Camera tv close-up it is the wrong time camera how the fuck did we end up with camera tv close-up active so now we know what's causing it.</p>
<p>Yeah it was it is a camera issue.</p>
<p>Right I need that's something else I need to fix.</p>
<p>Tv boo pc boo pc boo.</p>
<p>Invisible.</p>
<p>Because tvc you.</p>
<p>Becoming active camera.</p>
<p>Find my fucking reason.</p>
<p>There thank you.</p>
<p>That's something I need to fix.</p>
<p>How can I get enough of my.</p>
<p>I just.</p>
<p>I just I don't even know.</p>
<p>Wow two vertical matches at once.</p>
<p>Switch off my.</p>
<p>I don't think I can work on this anymore right now.</p>
<p>I'm too lost in all it's just it's two overwhelming.</p>
<p>I don't even know where to.</p>
<p>The thing that's really breaking my brain right is this like this is where it's so weird to me.</p>
<p>Because this version of the scr.</p>
<p>Put to one side it works.</p>
<p>Perfectly aside from.</p>
<p>Anything.</p>
<p>What seems like a tiny thing and the tiny thing is.</p>
<p>That it's only moving one space.</p>
<p>And for certain matches it needs to move multiple spaces that seems so inconsequential to me because it's like ok we did all the hard work of getting it to move doing the swapping updating the food all this other stuff it's working great.</p>
<p>And so normally in programming if you just need to take a function.</p>
<p>Play fleshed out and you need to just find like you just need to repeat it a certain number of times for whatever reason under certain conditions that's pretty easy to do.</p>
<p>The hard part is getting the function of work properly but in this it's the other way around.</p>
<p>Which probably suggests that there's something about the function that when it's running a second time.</p>
<p>And put it here.</p>
<p>And let's put the original single run version back in.</p>
<p>Is this the entire script by the way.</p>
<p>We're about to find out.</p>
<p>I think I need to sign it to check that the the single iteration.</p>
<p>Is actually doing everything correctly.</p>
<p>Look at that it's beautiful.</p>
<p>It works perfectly.</p>
<p>Right so let's just sign it you check this right.</p>
<p>So visually everything is we know everything is correct visually because we can see it happening.</p>
<p>But what about the the data field's are they matching up so we can see our food items here.</p>
<p>If we go into our grid cells we want to look at 3839.40.</p>
<p>For 38 is come up as food type 3.</p>
<p>What's 0 that's 1 that's 2 that's 3 which is a drink.</p>
<p>39.</p>
<p>Which is actually 38 on here.</p>
<p>Show us food item one.</p>
<p>Is a pizza slice so that's also correct.</p>
<p>Yeah this would take forever to go in the inspector let's make a quick tool he's a better idea if we make a quick function now.</p>
<p>What is basically going to do is it's gonna eat read through.</p>
<p>We can either go through.</p>
<p>Play cells.</p>
<p>Are we can go through food squares.</p>
<p>I'll do for each.</p>
<p>Raw image.</p>
<p>What type of list is that.</p>
<p>So for each raw image get image.</p>
<p>In food squares.</p>
<p>Am I going to need an index.</p>
<p>I'm going to say.</p>
<p>Get image.</p>
<p>Texture.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Grid cells.</p>
<p>A position in bags.</p>
<p>Food item.</p>
<p>Is the number that's to get the number so we got a food items food type.</p>
<p>Food type.</p>
<p>At that index.</p>
<p>Damage.</p>
<p>Yields return new web for ender frame.</p>
<p>Run check.</p>
<p>If run check.</p>
<p>Start quarantine.</p>
<p>Sunny check.</p>
<p>And we need to make sure we don't run that on an infinite loop.</p>
<p>My reason for doing this is it going to take.</p>
<p>Do I need inspector and make sure that every single food items in.</p>
<p>Is registered correctly against the image of vice versa.</p>
<p>So by running this we update the images based on what's in the date of birth so after we've done the matches and everything is moved we're looking for changes so I have to do is click one button.</p>
<p>It looks fine to me because you can see it happening.</p>
<p>Ok we got an out of range exception.</p>
<p>Well that's.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>-1 right.</p>
<p>Get food equals.</p>
<p>Dread cells index food type.</p>
<p>So index.</p>
<p>Grid cells index food.</p>
<p>So texture is texture.</p>
<p>Else.</p>
<p>Texture is empt.</p>
<p>Does food items of the same things that drop down but what about the empty squares right if they're wrong we need to know about it.</p>
<p>There you go see so we've got a problem so this is so silly is it so we've got a problem so what's the problem the problem is that there's two drinks in the squares that shouldn't exist.</p>
<p>And i'm betting with my drinks.</p>
<p>Ok so where is that happening.</p>
<p>Because I distinctly remember everything we sent to the throne we went and changed the food item the food item negative 1.</p>
<p>So that's weird.</p>
<p>I mean we are setting an empty texture.</p>
<p>Yeah also.</p>
<p>This is the bit I remember putting in.</p>
<p>But don't forget we've got h matches and v matches so maybe we only did it on one.</p>
<p>So it's probably also worth checking empty texture because empty texture.</p>
<p>Reference to the.</p>
<p>I seem to remember.</p>
<p>Let's just see what that does.</p>
<p>Where did it in three places I think.</p>
<p>For the post match.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>I can't there we go.</p>
<p>Program to handle that.</p>
<p>Kissing the finished game that i'll never happened.</p>
<p>How much is look great because they aren't there any sports to move down one cell.</p>
<p>It's the v matches that's the issue and if we got like a double h match because we did like a swap like a vertical swap.</p>
<p>Ok i'm happy that that now seems to be reflecting what we're seeing.</p>
<p>Which is good and important.</p>
<p>So then I remember asking.</p>
<p>Chat gpt.</p>
<p>I was like i've managed to get food to drop to the bottom by recalling the car routine.</p>
<p>But I need to do on the food items above.</p>
<p>This felt like progress to me and i'm wondering if.</p>
<p>The mismatch of database values might have been fucking things up for us.</p>
<p>So this is the card we had to make that work.</p>
<p>So let's put that back in.</p>
<p>Progress to me.</p>
<p>Is it felt like we were one step closer to where we want to be.</p>
<p>I mean that was a bad example right because that that is exactly what we want but it happened to be right at the top.</p>
<p>The item that dropped happened to be.</p>
<p>So it was a bad test really.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>What is this seems like progress to me this is like this is so close now all I need to do this seems like a good place to like snapshot it or back it up or something all I need now is to get.</p>
<p>It seems so fucking simple as well write all I need to know to do now is to apply the same.</p>
<p>Looping logic.</p>
<p>To these three food items that were above the burger.</p>
<p>And have them do the same thing that the burger does.</p>
<p>Which just sounds like it should be so simple.</p>
<p>On a copy the script.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I'm pretty maybe I should just leave it there and look at like it might actually be a good idea cos I don't want to end on a negative no I don't want to feel bad i've been at this a while now.</p>
<p>4 1/2 hours.</p>
<p>And I also feel like if I come back at this.</p>
<p>Tomorrow or something.</p>
<p>From this kind of checkpoint.</p>
<p>And look at it with a fresh.</p>
<p>Outlook.</p>
<p>Then you know hopefully I can be like yeah.</p>
<p>Let's try this again.</p>
<p>Let's give it one little.</p>
<p>Little girl.</p>
<p>So the magical chord that made that happen.</p>
<p>It's basically we look at the next target cell.</p>
<p>Which is the selby law.</p>
<p>And we find out is that sell empty or not.</p>
<p>And if it is then we add ourself to.</p>
<p>The thing that needs to change is instead of just saying oh yes.</p>
<p>I am the thing that needs to be added.</p>
<p>What I also need to do is add my add the food items above my head.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>How's that for a conversation.</p>
<p>So originally as I started typing this bit I was thinking ok.</p>
<p>So this point the cell above me.</p>
<p>But this is where it gets tricky.</p>
<p>Why this gets tricky.</p>
<p>Do I have to use my fists.</p>
<p>So why it's difficult right.</p>
<p>Is wear this cell here.</p>
<p>And we're going to go down we're going to go down to this cell harry replace it with what we are the jump back up.</p>
<p>Empty ourselves.</p>
<p>And we're relying on the fact that the seller brothers is going to be doing the same thing as us so they sell below is going to be coming down or was replacing us with what it has.</p>
<p>But all this is happening at once this is what's tricky about it.</p>
<p>So at this point in the chord.</p>
<p>You can't know because we work from the bottom up.</p>
<p>So the chord.</p>
<p>Maybe that's the problem maybe maybe i'm wrong about that maybe maybe it would be better if we run from the top down.</p>
<p>Cuz this this is one of my issues one of my issues is.</p>
<p>So we ask the seller brothers are you empty.</p>
<p>And if you are not.</p>
<p>Then we're going to add you.</p>
<p>To the coroutine to get you to drop again as well.</p>
<p>My problem is every single cell.</p>
<p>Is emptying itself when it gets to this point.</p>
<p>And being replaced with.</p>
<p>A different texture oh that doesn't that already tell me the fact that the cells don't all become empty.</p>
<p>Tells me.</p>
<p>Did the overrated the texture is overriding.</p>
<p>Sell above.</p>
<p>After the sellers emptied.</p>
<p>But that's still doesn't tell me weather.</p>
<p>Why don't I have any vertical matches.</p>
<p>There's one year I guess.</p>
<p>Write it didn't.</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>So I think the reason it didn't work is because.</p>
<p>At the at the moment that we query the cell to see whether it was empty on it.</p>
<p>The cell was actually empty.</p>
<p>Even though.</p>
<p>It ultimately became that pizza slice.</p>
<p>It just hadn't turned into the pizza slice yet.</p>
<p>I'm going to try something crazy i've been convinced all day long that this must go.</p>
<p>Turn up because if it doesn't we're going to end up with empty cells everywhere.</p>
<p>But now i'm not so sure.</p>
<p>Because the downside of that is.</p>
<p>The pizza slice hasn't become the pizza slice when we need to know if it's a pizza slice but if it run top down we would know.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>So when when we get before we give.</p>
<p>The drop food it's.</p>
<p>It's list I want to try something real quick.</p>
<p>I'm going to reverse the eye drops list.</p>
<p>So we're going to do it top down.</p>
<p>And I see what happens.</p>
<p>I worry that we're going to end up with empty textures instead of the items that.</p>
<p>They're supposed to be yeah I told you.</p>
<p>I'm kind of glad I was right it shows how well I understand a lot of the stuff now.</p>
<p>Which creates the problem of.</p>
<p>Pizza slice.</p>
