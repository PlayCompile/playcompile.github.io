<h3>From Live stream on Sunday 25-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt1EMyzWO6E​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt1EMyzWO6E​</a></h3>
<p>There is always.</p>
<p>There's always a problem.</p>
<p>Youtube tries still broken I don't know if it could be that the api got flooded earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Please show the allowance thing resets every day so it should have been working.</p>
<p>Since I fixed the original bug where it was constantly making api calls to update the stream of a 2 minutes.</p>
<p>That's now fixed.</p>
<p>Put youtube chat is.</p>
<p>Not working.</p>
<p>Ok let me take a look at this before we get any.</p>
<p>Before we get into this.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on.</p>
<p>He also had the bug with the camera which should now be fixed.</p>
<p>But i'm leaving the debug text on the screen because.</p>
<p>I want to make sure.</p>
<p>You're not sure how much I can rely on unit 6 right now unisex is not.</p>
<p>Why does it want to run ads again.</p>
<p>It's running ads again I got too many requests.</p>
<p>From twitch chat.</p>
<p>It's supposed to find.</p>
<p>Ok now it's not.</p>
<p>It could be the twitch rejected the api call and said too many requests so we couldn't get the tag.</p>
<p>That's probably what happened there.</p>
<p>I just ran the edit version too soon after the the build version did the api request and switch rejected the request which was like your chill out like you know.</p>
<p>Don't bothers.</p>
<p>Ok I want to turn that down so youtube chat now.</p>
<p>Text I think it's like 2 minutes before.</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>It will start and i'm trying to think.</p>
<p>Can you remember when and where that happens.</p>
<p>I don't know I am so losing track of all this it's in.</p>
<p>Try to jump in and out of projects as well as just like my brain is not thinking along.</p>
<p>I worked on the match 3 game all night last night of streaming I actually managed to fix a lot about.</p>
<p>It was hell.</p>
<p>Ok let me see if I can figure this out.</p>
<p>Where the frick is youtube chat.</p>
<p>In the first place I can't even remember I need to organise this thing this thing is like it's just not very well organised it's like all over the freaking place services there's about six different versions of chat now.</p>
<p>Why is it not on the services.</p>
<p>We've got chat.</p>
<p>Twitch jazz new chat which was.</p>
<p>Visual chat bubbles.</p>
<p>Because that was replacing an old chats essentially but why it isn't part of chat I have no idea I just guessed I didn't make it that way.</p>
<p>Which is annoying so there's two charts but then youtube chat is somewhere else.</p>
<p>I can never find it where did I put youtube chat.</p>
<p>Why isn't it with the other chat.</p>
<p>Oh my god I genuinely don't know where it is I always struggle to find it so wherever the hell i've put it it's not a very.</p>
<p>Flash clear chat bad news that's moderation.</p>
<p>That's my motivation system auto ads.</p>
<p>Might be the thing that activates youtube chat but I can't remember.</p>
<p>I don't think so because it's only got a it's only got a connection to twitch info twitch info has right here we go twitch in for right it's just it's a child of chat.</p>
<p>But the weird thing about that.</p>
<p>That's why I can never find it ok so it's a child of chat.</p>
<p>But it's.</p>
<p>I feel like youtube's disabled.</p>
<p>Did I leave it turned off or something.</p>
<p>Youtube chat api so this is for this is for youtube streaming services.</p>
<p>And then chat is.</p>
<p>Get youtube chat id.</p>
<p>Then connect to youtube chat api.</p>
<p>Ok let me just test this.</p>
<p>Yeah this always happens where i'll run it in the editor and everything works perfectly fine and then I build it out and everything turns to shit and it's like well it works fine in the editor why is it why isn't it just working in the build it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Everything is fine.</p>
<p>Youtube chat is working fine we can see it right here.</p>
<p>Everything is fine.</p>
<p>It's successfully got the video id a successfully got the chat room i'd it's spawn the youtube api.</p>
<p>That's running.</p>
<p>So I just I don't know.</p>
<p>Do anything I can think the only thing I can think.</p>
<p>Is it.</p>
<p>Is if the new camera system that I added that does the intro screen is responsible for starting up youtube chat after the delay and that's getting interrupted when I go into the build and I start the stream straight away.</p>
<p>It's like it's it's passing over it's skipping over the part where youtube like warms up and does it shit.</p>
<p>Does there anything I can think of.</p>
<p>Might be broken up.</p>
<p>But I don't I don't think scene switcher starts youtube chat.</p>
<p>I'm trying to think what it was that I did there was an issue with the warm up screen i'm trying to think what it was there was an issue with the warm up screen where something was like taking a little bit of time it was trying to do something too early and then when I was trying to do it yeah it was it was for auto ads so when I was trying to write here's what was happening when I was trying to implement the auto ads system and I was like ok we need to run an ad within the first.</p>
<p>Turn the works because what I noticed early is.</p>
<p>Trying to make those api calls to twitch.</p>
<p>What's the like basically retrieve all the metadata from the stream.</p>
<p>Does causing massive errors.</p>
<p>So I think all I ended up doing to fix.</p>
<p>Make the api request.</p>
<p>I think that's handled by the new.</p>
<p>Add system.</p>
<p>But that shouldn't affect youtube.</p>
<p>Well maybe.</p>
<p>If anything's breaking youtube chart.</p>
<p>System.</p>
<p>It's not looking good.</p>
<p>I know there it is.</p>
<p>Because we have to so youtube chat there are two types of apis out there right there are what's called restful apis.</p>
<p>Under a non restful.</p>
<p>What are restful api does is you connect to it and then it just stays in a rest mode right and then you can just send messages back forward to it all day long.</p>
<p>So if you imagine like i.</p>
<p>He answers and he says you know what.</p>
<p>That's a restful api.</p>
<p>Youtube and it's amazing wisdom is a non restful api which is absolutely insane because it's like run by goo it's like so bad especially for something like chat because what it essentially means is you have to pull it manually every single time so if you want to receive a chat message from twitch you connect to twitch app twitch chat api and it just sends you the messages.</p>
<p>Youtube is a non restful api meaning.</p>
<p>You have to specifically say hey youtube do you have any chat messages for me and then pull the chat messages and then have a look to see if any of them are new and then decide whether you display any of those messages and you have to manually do that every yourself so like you can have you can do it every second you can do it every 5 seconds you do it every 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The stupidest part the stupidest part is they limit you to something like 100 connections by default right or you can only make 100 api request now on the on the surface of it on the face of it that sounds decent right oh well I can I can send 100 apr requests a day for free that seems like a lot not really if you could not win it's a non restful api because you have to check for chat messages let's see you stream for an hour right and you only check for chat messages once every minute which would be really really bad right because it's someone types of chat message and the thing and what the hell is he just ignoring me like you don't mean who tries sitting there waiting for a minute.</p>
<p>Not a very that's not a very engaging thing for.</p>
<p>Snooze the timer there so what I had to literally do was request.</p>
<p>What I literally had to do was request from youtube additional api access you have to get it approved and then tell them why you need it and i'm like we'll do I need it cos i'm making an interactive chat for my stream.</p>
<p>But it's still limited it's just that there is the limit so when I program youtube chat I have two modes I have a slow mode and a fast mode and what it basically does is it will it will default to slow mode which checks it every let's say 20 seconds for a new message but I am aware that that's not very engaging if somebody is actually in chat trying to talk to you so what happens is we wait for the first message to come through every 20 seconds if we detect a new message we then got a fast mode and we say ok i'm now going to check every 5 seconds for a new message and then after I don't know whatever a minute if no more messages come through it goes back to checking it once every 20 seconds because every api request is being taken off my allowance each day it's insane.</p>
<p>It's not difficult to do like I can make one myself.</p>
<p>Why the hell youtube isn't on restful api I have no idea it makes no sense.</p>
<p>It makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>Bring it back bring it back to time on.</p>
<p>Can you make a drink.</p>
<p>If i'm trying to think did I even drink.</p>
<p>I may have had a like one or two drinks like last new year or last christmas and that would have been about it.</p>
<p>We had a celebration.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
<p>Synonym of celebrating.</p>
<p>It was good cuz I hate being drunk and I was I wasn't even.</p>
<p>But you're noticed that when you stop drinking.</p>
<p>Can you go and have a drink like you just have zero tolerance build up.</p>
<p>What's the real thing and so you can have like one one or two drinks and be like holy shit that's not the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Two tipsy or whatever it's just it's just awful but yeah that was great I had two drinks and didn't.</p>
<p>So let's see where is parramatta will we managed to you'll be amazed at the progress you'll be amazed.</p>
<p>So almost done.</p>
<p>We're almost done with hungry hun.</p>
<p>So what what is it doing what is it not doing what does it need to do and what are all these numbers mean.</p>
<p>Ok well let's first just match these burgers here.</p>
<p>Yeah so you'll see what it does is.</p>
<p>How many it's finally dropping food right and it's I just not I just noticed a new test that all right.</p>
<p>Finally dropping down as you can see and it's generating new food at the top so almost looks like it's finished right but in that very first test that I did there we actually had a line of burgers and it made like an l shape.</p>
<p>And I think and also you'll notice the other thing what it's doing right is is you'll notice there are three french fries here.</p>
<p>Now three french fries is a.</p>
<p>So essentially.</p>
<p>What we need to do now what what is happening.</p>
<p>Is when we do when we do our initial march.</p>
<p>So what's basically happening is it's not as the food drops down.</p>
<p>When it generates new food it's not.</p>
<p>It's not checking for matches again.</p>
<p>But aside from that it is pretty good and then I just need to think about scarring so the way I was originally going to set this up I think.</p>
<p>So I give the player a number of moves I believe that's this one here 8.</p>
<p>This is the players number of moves.</p>
<p>Set number of moves and then I have a hunger.</p>
<p>A hunger score there which seems to go up rather than down.</p>
<p>But I guess.</p>
<p>Because I eventually i'm going to make that a hunger bar right like a like a scroll bar not scroll bar progress bar.</p>
<p>And so we're going to try and fill it to 100% essentially.</p>
<p>It's so nice to be able to just actually play the game and continue to play and it just it works.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>How do we get the food.</p>
<p>That's I guess that's my fault though.</p>
<p>It's all my fault yeah maybe I need to work on my match algorithm.</p>
<p>Ok so what we do at the moment is we call a function called player match let's find player match.</p>
<p>Here is player match.</p>
<p>What I essentially do is I do a horizontal check.</p>
<p>What's up.</p>
<p>Replace them.</p>
<p>Do vertical match checks so we make a list called h check which basically what it does let's get the bottom.</p>
<p>Play basically just remembers what was the last food I was a burger what's this is it a burger yeah ok we'll add one add once you counter that's two burgers in a raw what's this french fries ok you match goes to 0 now but this is freeze as well ok that's that's too much is counting how many at the same and then I obviously has to reset at the end of every raw and that's why we need to do separate one for vertical matches as well so I guess that's the reason why when we first tested it this morning and we had like an l shape.</p>
<p>What is interesting because h matches should have found that and v matches should have found it but what i'm guessing is happening is instead of waiting for hitch matches in v matches to finish.</p>
<p>Connect the matches.</p>
<p>My catch matches is completing its cycle so by the time so let's let's get the bar the second right let's get the board.</p>
<p>Right so I think in in the demo.</p>
<p>That we run this morning in the in the first test this morning we had a match like this.</p>
<p>And so h check would have gone across and said yeah i've got a match three here now v march obviously should have gone here and said oh yeah guess what i've got a match here so both heads check and vtec needs to find a match of three but what I suspect is happening instead is hedge much is saying ok let me just get these guys.</p>
<p>As a match I will send those off.</p>
<p>But then we check comes along and says ok i'm going to look for matches but these are all now gone.</p>
<p>This is what I think is happening these are now all gone.</p>
<p>Cancel the match says oh no there's only.</p>
<p>I think we check should include that because at the end of the day you've got not just got a match of three this way you've got a match of three this way as well.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at our code.</p>
<p>Yeah so you'll see here this is where we give the throw the food so this is where we gather the food up we give it to the throne and the thrower throws the food at home on.</p>
<p>This is where we take a move off the player.</p>
<p>Unscathed for the match.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok so what i'm going to do let's just copy this code first.</p>
<p>Yeah so it's a bit more complicated than that because.</p>
<p>Checking that I just talked about these that would be these here.</p>
<p>He's a basically list generators ok so you've got a list integer generator forget hatches and what essentially it's going to do is it's going to return a list of cells.</p>
<p>That have horizontally matched food in them and then we've got a similar function here which is a list generator of images that gets a vertical matches and it's going to return a list of vertical matches.</p>
<p>And you'll see the.</p>
<p>And play a match.</p>
<p>What we do is we declare a list of integers called h check in which we call on the function of get horizontal matches.</p>
<p>So we know that when this comes back we have a list of horizontal matches.</p>
<p>I can't remember because it was a while ago.</p>
<p>Weather every cell is included I just to start index of the match.</p>
<p>If we want to know what we can do as we can do a debug.log and we'll just say h check dart count.</p>
<p>All right so let's do some matches.</p>
<p>What's a three burgers ok.</p>
<p>So you'll see it came back with one ok so what it does it gives a start index.</p>
<p>Yeah so it went it said we have one match one match one match so what we got was a horizontal a horizontal and a vertical.</p>
<p>So the match length doesn't come back in this list what instead it it's.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>When I made that what instead what it's probably doing is it's just giving it's just giving a cell number.</p>
<p>Of weather match starts and then we have a separate function that then says ok let's see what's in the cell oh it's french fries and it knows where it's horizontal or vertical match right so from that we can literally just say ok i'm i'm starting let's say it's so for example let's set starting let me rest this.</p>
<p>It just keeps going and counting.</p>
<p>Things that we got so all it does is check what is in the cell and then it says ok well I need to count how many of these are in the neighbouring cells essentially.</p>
<p>Say yeah that makes sense.</p>
<p>It's only part of the equation right the other the other part of the equation is like ok where are we counting.</p>
<p>Per iteration.</p>
<p>Yeah ok so we we do we do a pirate duration so we know we matched one while per iteration is less than much count.</p>
<p>Last match count match index plus 1 what the hell is this.</p>
<p>Last match count what the hell is last match count.</p>
<p>This isn't this doesn't seem particularly.</p>
<p>Efficient.</p>
<p>So i've also got a private list of it it just called last match count which i'm guessing is starring.</p>
<p>The length of the matches.</p>
<p>So why the hell did not just.</p>
<p>If I was going to do the match function right now I would just basically collect all the cells that have the match.</p>
<p>And I would just say there you go.</p>
<p>The play got these these match threes so in the l shape I would literally just says.</p>
<p>Isn't there a click where to like clear everything.</p>
<p>Soft and stupid.</p>
<p>To the food dropper.</p>
<p>But apparently i'm not doing it that way.</p>
<p>Ok i'm going to make cos I have no idea what the hell this thing is doing.</p>
<p>Why did I do it that way.</p>
<p>Where's last match count.</p>
<p>So let's.</p>
<p>Let's match something.</p>
<p>That's so freaking weird.</p>
<p>But then we matched the second time and it became empty.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems to.</p>
<p>Put derek didn't it seems like on the vertical matches it's not clearing itself out.</p>
<p>Turn on the horizontal matches it is clearing itself out.</p>
<p>Ok and it can store more than one match count.</p>
<p>I'm going to guess that I use this for scarring probably.</p>
<p>This probably more for scarring than anything else.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>New matches ok so well anyway either way.</p>
<p>I'm too tired.</p>
<p>This is so weird.</p>
<p>So we don't we don't update last match count here either so i'm guessing i'll list functions of last match count.</p>
<p>Ok ok ok ok ok.</p>
<p>I want to find out what happens ok so the reason it wasn't doing the l shape.</p>
<p>Empty the food.</p>
<p>Necessarily need to do that.</p>
<p>In terms of it being a database.</p>
<p>Ok so the reason he's the reason why it's exactly what I said basically.</p>
<p>The reason why it wasn't doing it didn't find a match of an l shape is because as we go on we collect our h matches what we essentially do as we turn these cells into being empty.</p>
<p>As we give the food the.</p>
<p>And then by the time v matches comes along and looks this way that once already gone.</p>
<p>Play only finds 2.</p>
<p>So if I don't empty it.</p>
<p>But i'm scared that's going to break something.</p>
<p>So what I could do is I could say for each.</p>
<p>What classes in grid cells.</p>
<p>Sell square.</p>
<p>Sofa each cell square cell in grid squares.</p>
<p>Red cells.</p>
<p>Texture.</p>
<p>Oh this is tricky.</p>
<p>We need a ninja.</p>
<p>So we're going to iterate through each cell and what we're going to do is we're going to check to see if the texture is empty because if the texture is empty.</p>
<p>It's basically food that was just matched.</p>
<p>Write it has to be.</p>
<p>But we don't want to update the food to negative 1 yet in the march because that's what's causing this error where it's gobbling up the food so v matches can't see it right so after the fact what we're gonna do is we're going to correct it and we're going to say a look if anything is visually empty right now make sure the actual sell class has it registered as being empty so that the next functions work correctly so we're going to say if so our image components are in food squares so what we want to do is we want to say if food squares.</p>
<p>Sell index.</p>
<p>Don't get components.</p>
<p>Raw image.</p>
<p>Texture.</p>
<p>Absolute equals empty texture.</p>
<p>Then go into our.</p>
<p>Sell and set food item.</p>
<p>Then we can start our quarantine of drop food after marches.</p>
<p>How often do you get an l-shaped match.</p>
<p>It's not that common right it's like.</p>
<p>In fact i'm just trying to think how does that even work.</p>
<p>You know what thinking about it because obviously you can't I don't think you can complete an l-shaped match in one move.</p>
<p>So I wonder if the only reason can you even do that I don't think you can because I think it's probably the other book where we're not checking for matches.</p>
<p>Oh my god why is this so fucking hard to clear the board can we please get a better erase all markups thank you fucking hell.</p>
<p>Add a burger here.</p>
<p>Even if you have a burger here and a burger here and a burger here and a burger here race.</p>
<p>If you move that to their.</p>
<p>And if you move this to hear or this to hear you want to match this.</p>
<p>I don't think you can make one move and create an l-shaped match.</p>
<p>Game like this.</p>
<p>You can't.</p>
<p>Yes you can i'm full of shit if you have a burger here and you move it there.</p>
<p>Ok well so far everything still seems to be working.</p>
<p>The logical assumption now.</p>
<p>Is the if we run this.</p>
<p>And i've tried this.</p>
<p>The logical assumption now is if we run player match.</p>
<p>As we generate the new food and and clear the board.</p>
<p>We should be able to.</p>
<p>Phil empty cells.</p>
<p>It seems logical right but when I tested this last night it doesn't actually work.</p>
<p>But I don't know why.</p>
<p>Right after you've dropped the food that fills these gaps go ahead and do an additional player match.</p>
<p>Yeah everything bro I didn't even move anything there.</p>
<p>I think the problem is we end up with multiple yeah then we get an index out of range exception so there's something weird happening right it seems like the coroutines are.</p>
<p>Just by adding that one line just by trying to run that coroutine.</p>
<p>Ok I know I know why that happens yeah it's because.</p>
<p>Maybe you don't actually.</p>
<p>I was wondering if we were calling it multiple times per drop I have no idea.</p>
<p>Play a million billion x so you can see I already put it in here last night and test.</p>
<p>But if we want to make sure that it's not being called too many times.</p>
<p>What we can do is do a debug.log and we'll just say.</p>
<p>Sing for matches.</p>
<p>And we can keep an eye on console and see how many times that shows up right.</p>
<p>So we should definitely see it as we.</p>
<p>As we move food so even if I make a food that doesn't match right let's let's just move this burger here.</p>
<p>So now it's just looking for marches looking for marches it's stuck in some kind of infinite loop.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be checking for matches over and over and over again like that but that's the problem I think it's because.</p>
<p>Is because of that new line that I added so you can see how that breaks everything.</p>
<p>Ok interesting.</p>
<p>And it makes sense because essentially what's happening is.</p>
<p>Every time we check for matches we then we then run.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>We run the drop food we were on the phil empty spaces script.</p>
<p>So essentially what we need to do is we need to know whether any food was dropped on.</p>
<p>To know whether this needs to check for matches again that's what it'll be so yeah I know what to do.</p>
<p>So we run it here as we place food down as the food gets placed down onto the grid.</p>
<p>And we run it now we're running it here.</p>
<p>After we filled the empty cells which this is like after food drops.</p>
<p>And we can check.</p>
<p>We'll see what normal behaviour looks like if we don't run that that will be what was causing the infinite loop so let's do the same test we did before which is just to move something that doesn't match.</p>
<p>But we need to get it to check for matches when food is dropped because there's a match right here right so how do we do that i'll get what we can do is we can say.</p>
<p>Will make a private pool.</p>
<p>Which are called do recheck which was set to false and essentially what we can do is we can say hey.</p>
<p>What does checked for matches we can say hey.</p>
<p>I've already checked for matches so do recheck equal.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>As we run our.</p>
<p>Here we can say f.</p>
<p>Do recheck.</p>
<p>Then check the.</p>
<p>Wrong one wrong place.</p>
<p>Do you know me whether it was.</p>
<p>Ok only if we only if the flag says to do a recheck should we do.</p>
<p>And then how do we turn that recheck to flag on well in drop food if any food is dropped.</p>
<p>It will call on move food.</p>
<p>Check this move food.</p>
<p>Saw cell target sell original position.</p>
<p>Target position.</p>
<p>It will come through this script here.</p>
<p>So my my guess is we set.</p>
<p>Do recheck to true here.</p>
<p>Log.</p>
<p>Shield every check for matches.</p>
<p>I think that will be fine but if it says it's queuing a reach it for much is even when food's not dropping then.</p>
<p>We're going into that coroutine weatherford is dropping or not which is bad.</p>
<p>But I don't think we will be.</p>
<p>Ok so the first thing to do is to move some food around and not make a match.</p>
<p>Check for matches once.</p>
<p>End of story ok let's make a match of burgers.</p>
<p>Check for matches.</p>
<p>Like 50 times which is fine because like 58 hours probably dropped right obviously.</p>
<p>And just a double check.</p>
<p>Reflux.</p>
<p>What does a flag flagged for recheck.</p>
<p>Flags for a recheck.</p>
<p>Works.</p>
<p>Yeah I fixed it.</p>
<p>That was big.</p>
<p>Oh this is so cool we did it.</p>
<p>We freaking did it.</p>
<p>There we go we did it.</p>
<p>I need to see how my scoring thing works as well right cuz the way I decided to make it work is like the more the lucky you get you get like extra moves back for doing big matches essentially.</p>
<p>What otherwise you run out of moves and when you run out of moves that will dictate your final score so really think of this is car and think of this is number of moves left.</p>
<p>I'm worried that the number of mooses never gonna.</p>
<p>I'm going to cover that i'm going to cover that next i'm going to show you what you can do for that so what we'll do there ok is will basically will play a match we're going to make a system the basically logs each set of points that the place god.</p>
<p>Move right we'll play a few games.</p>
<p>You seem to be scarring between here and here when we're doing really well and between here and here when we're not doing so well and then we can balance it based off of that.</p>
<p>Ok i'm down to five moves.</p>
<p>Holy shit with getting so many matches that was so cool we need some sound effects now.</p>
<p>This is good this is working really well.</p>
<p>I feel so good to see actually.</p>
<p>What's it going to be a double.</p>
<p>Ok so let's look for a sound effects if we can't youtube.</p>
<p>We want like some fun like I don't know.</p>
<p>Jingle sound effect or something you know like a you know like a win.</p>
<p>Radio jingles.</p>
<p>Short jingles sound effect what's this.</p>
<p>No no.</p>
<p>Victory jingle.</p>
<p>Old school achievement.</p>
<p>Ok let's go for ding sound effect and see what what comes up.</p>
<p>I know what it is in my head.</p>
<p>Magic chime.</p>
<p>Jesus that's poem on in a bad mood.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>That is the buddha just walked in and made some green tea.</p>
<p>That's fucking resident evil fucking time on that.</p>
<p>Who are my god.</p>
<p>Play my zombies.</p>
<p>This is so boring.</p>
<p>Game sound effects.</p>
<p>Top 20 arcade sound effects let's see what we're going here.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>I guarantee you this app will have an update this app seems to get updated 60 times a day I don't think i've ever opened this app and it's not had an update.</p>
<p>That was so good that was so good check it out that is so good I want to put it on in a second.</p>
<p>So this is and I think.</p>
<p>Play game somewhere cos it first I thought somebody I thought some like hobbies that like mixed it themselves but I think it's actually in the game but quacker jacket is like a quick jagger.</p>
<p>It's basically all of the faction.</p>
<p>Theme tunes from zen + all like kind of like mixed together so that like it'll play one faction and then another factions then another but it all like seamlessly blends together and i.</p>
<p>My favourite music I don't need my favourite audio editing software.</p>
<p>From like 1990 something.</p>
<p>2003.</p>
<p>Before I became adobe audition this is back when it used to be good.</p>
<p>If I derby ruined it.</p>
<p>What's because you were too slow.</p>
<p>Dumbass.</p>
<p>Ok go to downloads.</p>
<p>Open top 20 right where was it.</p>
<p>Ok let's go.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>What's tidy up a little bit.</p>
<p>That seems good to me.</p>
<p>We want to save that in our project folder so it's actually find that.</p>
<p>I don't think we have sound specifically for python.</p>
<p>So first of all let's go through our music.</p>
<p>I have some already.</p>
<p>Actually I think I took it out for whatever reason just to make things quicker to copy and back up and whatnot.</p>
<p>Why why did it delete the music.</p>
<p>It's ok we can do we'll make a music folder from march 3 or sounds.</p>
<p>Sound.</p>
<p>I'm a college.</p>
<p>How much.</p>
<p>Fx.</p>
<p>Yeah where is all the music.</p>
<p>Let me see I can't believe why am I trying to run stuff.</p>
<p>Okay we still have it here look in our original play compile many games is because I really think it.</p>
<p>That might make more sense being called music so rename any it cuz.</p>
<p>Specific.</p>
<p>Where's the music's kind of a global thing.</p>
<p>But yeah if we want to just like preview this now.</p>
<p>Why would you give me my are you seeing this.</p>
<p>It won't let me move my.</p>
<p>File explorer window it won't let me do anything with it right now it did.</p>
<p>Computer bitch.</p>
<p>Which is very rude I just want to point that out ok so.</p>
<p>What's 01 will start the bottom and work I will I guess.</p>
<p>Let's see which one we want.</p>
<p>Why I want something more action than this that's like that's like a monkey island or something.</p>
<p>Sneaky music.</p>
<p>Church with.</p>
<p>Say I kind of want it to be maybe a bit more chaotic than that.</p>
<p>Maybe the chase music.</p>
<p>Good lord.</p>
<p>When you like the little guy with the glasses and.</p>
<p>Let's see what else we can find.</p>
<p>I want like kind of chaotic.</p>
<p>43 music.</p>
<p>Songs with celtic.</p>
<p>Skirt chairs.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>This isn't chaotic.</p>
<p>Charlie chaplin.</p>
<p>Oh this could be ok.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing I was thinking.</p>
<p>This is great this is what we want.</p>
<p>This is perfect this is what we want to sit we found our music.</p>
<p>This is perfect.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So we can add an audio source on here for the music.</p>
<p>Seems fine.</p>
<p>I can't live pixel peacock.</p>
<p>But still.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me ok so what we'll do is.</p>
<p>And then you show.</p>
<p>Yeah but you did.</p>
<p>Lurking in the shadows.</p>
<p>Ok so what will do is we will make.</p>
<p>Quite a few years.</p>
<p>The best way to do it is to create something called an audio manager we can get chat gpd to help with this.</p>
<p>Let me think.</p>
<p>Let me just think for a second.</p>
<p>Gpd.</p>
<p>Who the hell is chachi dvd.</p>
<p>Why don't we have a scripts folder for hungry hungry poem on.</p>
<p>Where are the scripts.</p>
<p>In ui ok I have no idea why it's in ui.</p>
<p>Ui has scripts in it apparently.</p>
<p>But no you are.</p>
<p>Ok march 3i so delete that folder I don't know why it says much 3 match 3.</p>
<p>I'll probably because.</p>
<p>The folder with with her ui in was in a folder called march 3 because it came from pyramid.</p>
<p>What we get.</p>
<p>What's she called.</p>
<p>The drill girl.</p>
<p>Kiara I think it's coward something like that.</p>
<p>We get her but we've got to complete than that one story together I think or the first part of that one story i'll be getting her anyway because i'm doing some pulse for short girl melania whatever name is.</p>
<p>Ok so what do we do so what I basically want to do one of the issues that i've always had.</p>
<p>With these games with unity with sound effects is ok what you normally do is you create an object you put an audio source on it you haven't played sound effect play on active whatever and then you activate sound effect you have to get the object that plays the sound effect the problem I found is.</p>
<p>In a very front again where you want lots of sound effects it the problem with that is you can only play one copy of that sound effect at the same time right.</p>
<p>So what i'm actually going to do.</p>
<p>Make i'm going to make a folder called prefabs within sound and then we're going to save prefabs of the sound effects here and then when it give them to our audio manager and we're going to tell our audio manager to clone an instantiate the sound effects as we call a function to play out plate.</p>
<p>Ok so basically.</p>
<p>So basically.</p>
<p>Here's how it's going to work.</p>
<p>Yeah barbara makes sense what about you also get chiang ling for doing spiral abyss.</p>
<p>Collie yeah we got that for free from the introduced her as free when samara came out.</p>
<p>Cat girl not as one more you're also getting you're also getting what she called.</p>
<p>Cucina.</p>
<p>Not one.</p>
<p>Apparently.</p>
<p>She looks fun that's all I care about she'll be fun.</p>
<p>My battery is running on my verb I need to get up.</p>
<p>And change it.</p>
<p>Anyway right let me figure this out so basically what we want to do is we want to create a new object that will be our audio object right so we want like a match sound effect right so we'll call it sfx match.</p>
<p>So we want to create a c sharp script called.</p>
<p>You guessed it.</p>
<p>We want to give the audio manager the audio manager script.</p>
<p>Go into the cord.</p>
<p>What we want to do here is want to make sure you've got system collections generic because we're going to create a public list.</p>
<p>Of game objects which we're going to give it the prefabs and we're going to call it.</p>
<p>Sounds.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you a list of game objects.</p>
<p>Hit save and assign this.</p>
<p>Now this is super important we must must must must must delete the original prefab from the list otherwise all sound effects will play on stars which we don't want then we want to open up our sounds list and when I got our prefab so i'm going to drag and drop our sound effect onto our audio manager so audio manager now has sound effect match as it's first sound effect.</p>
<p>What the hell is a scooby-doo game.</p>
<p>Don't say it again.</p>
<p>Now please.</p>
<p>Jesus christ.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So what we're going to do.</p>
<p>Blurry.</p>
<p>That sounds like there were two that sounds like they're being scaled up too much that's what happens if you scale.</p>
<p>Filtering on it.</p>
<p>And yeah the answer to call the assets that probably.</p>
<p>So go to.</p>
<p>Are pc boo cos and our pc boo we made an audio manager so i'm just going to take a look.</p>
<p>Audio manager scripts because.</p>
<p>Could you help me.</p>
<p>Make the cylinder reuse code from other projects from the best thing one of the best things about being old right so this is what I basically wanted so what we want to do we want to make this a public static audio manager instance.</p>
<p>And what that essentially does is it makes it a singleton instance now what the hell is a singleton instance.</p>
<p>So what that basically does is it basically says we want one instance and one instance only of which we're going to call functions on and then this this instance manager is going to be responsible for handling the functions that we call on it so you'll see the on a week we set this up right so we need this.</p>
<p>So put that in.</p>
<p>What this is basically saying is look.</p>
<p>So what we said to do is we say on a week if this instance is null set the instance to this instance if there are any additional instances running destroy them and this just makes sure.</p>
<p>We only have one instance running.</p>
<p>How can you be ahead of me.</p>
<p>How.</p>
<p>How no I refuse to believe it.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<p>Okay so.</p>
<p>What we do here is we give it a function right called play sound and what i'm going to do is i'm going to say play sound in clip index.</p>
<p>Ok so there are several ways we could make this work the problem I found with my pc boo audio manager is I don't always know what the sounds are and looking them up can be a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Stop playing the sound effects can be a pain in the ass because I don't know what sound what number and what sound each sound effect is.</p>
<p>Sfx march.</p>
<p>So I think what i'll do instead.</p>
<p>Tons of free stuff tons of quite of life improvements so much new stuff.</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing time to get into it.</p>
<p>Why are you sending messages within the cool down picker can you play non-stop through the day if one of his viewers caught up to him in any game he plays.</p>
<p>Ok so what I would rather do is take a string.</p>
<p>So what we going to do instead on our version is we're going to say.</p>
<p>Are functions going to be called play sound and we're going to take a string of clip name.</p>
<p>If we can set this up so we can take either.</p>
<p>Right let's find out if that's possible.</p>
<p>So let's set up a.</p>
<p>Instruction.</p>
<p>I'd like to set this.</p>
<p>Function of.</p>
<p>So that it can take an index number.</p>
<p>Lower.</p>
<p>Eclipse name.</p>
<p>So they can take an index number or eclipse named string.</p>
<p>No that's not I already know the answer the answer the answer is it's not possible because it's going to demand that you send.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Although there is one way around that what we could do this is such a weird way of doing it but ok.</p>
<p>How can I detect if the.</p>
<p>And passed.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Call me a number.</p>
<p>And convert it.</p>
<p>Call index.</p>
<p>Ok so seeing if in tripods clip name out in index.</p>
<p>Play sound by index play sound by name.</p>
<p>Ok that's fun.</p>
<p>That's cool ok that's now now we're really getting advanced so my audio manager will now accept either the index of the sound are the name of the sound.</p>
<p>Is it raining at first standard c sharp which is no good.</p>
<p>If not use the clip name to play the sound.</p>
<p>Ok perfect.</p>
<p>So we'll call that clip name or index so that it's clear.</p>
<p>We can accept both there we go.</p>
<p>Essentially want to do is we have a prefab there.</p>
<p>And we want to instantiate it.</p>
<p>So what we do is we can say.</p>
<p>Declare a game object as create new and that game object wants to be instantiate.</p>
<p>And then we want our sounds at position index.</p>
<p>Then we can say create new set active to false.</p>
<p>So turn it off and turn it back on again is essentially what we're doing and then that will cause the sound to flare.</p>
<p>And then what will probably do.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>We should kill we should kill the object.</p>
<p>So this might need to be a coroutine.</p>
<p>Numerator class it is system.</p>
<p>Wait for audio to stop playing and destroy the clan.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>What we also need to do is make sure when we when we call these here we now need to start the mascara team so we need to turn that into stock quarantine and then it doesn't parenthesis and same goes for this.</p>
<p>Start quarantine.</p>
<p>Play something by index.</p>
<p>So let's ask it here.</p>
<p>How can I auto destroy.</p>
<p>The clone win the sound has finished.</p>
<p>Playing.</p>
<p>Ok so there we go so what is suggesting we do is we yet we yield return you wait until audio source is no longer playing.</p>
<p>That's cool I didn't know you could do that that's actually fucking awesome.</p>
<p>That's really cool.</p>
<p>Ok and then we want to do the same thing.</p>
<p>So before we instantiate the objects for this one we need to find the object of that name right find object by name so for that what we can do is we can say in.</p>
<p>Add index equals negative 1 because that's an invalid index and we can set for each.</p>
<p>Let me see game objects in sounds.</p>
<p>And it doesn't like that for some reason.</p>
<p>Sound object I guess in sounds if sound object dart name.</p>
<p>Is the same as name.</p>
<p>Then out index.</p>
<p>Index equals 0 and then we increment index here and in here we can say at index equals index.</p>
<p>Yeah and if the index that way if the index isn't found.</p>
<p>Can index will return a zero and it will play the first sound.</p>
<p>Ok cool that should work.</p>
<p>How do we use this now so what we do.</p>
<p>Is in our projects so let's see what where should we place it.</p>
<p>Right so when we get a march.</p>
<p>We could tell our thrower that wants to throw get some objects added.</p>
<p>If throw these dart count is greater than 0 then we go ahead and we start throwing objects right this would be a good place to do our audio manager.</p>
<p>So basically what we can do is we can say.</p>
<p>Audio manager.</p>
<p>Instance.</p>
<p>Don't play sounds.</p>
<p>We can either play by index.</p>
<p>Are we can play by sound am right for me this time it's easier just to say zero so we'll see if that works.</p>
<p>And what that will now do is.</p>
<p>Play multiple sound effects at once which it doesn't do by default but we just made it do it by basically having it clone the sound effect object and then and then basically.</p>
<p>We can change the volume on that if we wanted.</p>
<p>That works really well actually so because the sound has an echo on the end if we didn't do that.</p>
<p>If we didn't do that it would.</p>
<p>You would cut the echo off short right and if we're getting matches really quickly the sounds will stack now.</p>
<p>Scoring what is a good score.</p>
<p>Problem is ok we need to see how many moves we get I think my problem now is i'm being too generous with the move so i'm giving extra moves how many moves do we start with.</p>
<p>12 that's probably too many.</p>
<p>Ok let's make it 10 moves.</p>
<p>Let's make it 10 moves by default ok.</p>
<p>Is it all handled is the num moves handled by game manager i'm guessing it is.</p>
<p>Yeah thanks man it's so good to see it finally working and coming together.</p>
<p>Reload that I guess.</p>
<p>Ok so number of moves is you guessed it a number of moves.</p>
<p>I'm guessing number of moves.</p>
<p>Is set to 12 there it is on start so let's start the play with 10 moves and see how long the game lasts.</p>
<p>Score three.</p>
<p>Cast god 6.</p>
<p>Ok we got all those and we got 7 moves left.</p>
<p>I feel so good.</p>
<p>We'll get this on the website soon.</p>
<p>See you guys can play.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I think that that felt pretty good so let's make a note of like what my score scars are so final score is 90 on our first run.</p>
<p>Let's play it again.</p>
<p>We could start with 12 moves.</p>
<p>I can't remember what conditions I gave moves back on I think it was like 4 + matches.</p>
<p>Which is kind of hard sometimes.</p>
<p>I think that seems fine that is either 10 or 12 moves what are you guys think.</p>
<p>Cuz getting a 4 + match is not always easy.</p>
<p>Yeah what I was also thinking as well.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Put like on certain moves right ok this is a good idea this is a good idea how about this.</p>
<p>So what time I could do is there a 4 food items right and let's do 12 moves and we can do a 369 and 12 python let's go one before cos that would be better I think.</p>
<p>Start 5 8 and 11 so I moved to 58 and 11 remaining time on will crave a specific food home and crabs food and if you give her that specific food you get extra points so what could happen is it the start we shuffle the food.</p>
<p>So that the cravings are in different artist each time and then pyramid will say ok i'll move to i'm craving whatever happened to be in slot one a burger let's say and if you give her if you give a burgers on that move you'll score extra points.</p>
<p>I like that I actually really like that.</p>
<p>I think I really like that alright let's let's set it up then.</p>
<p>Will make a.</p>
<p>Public list of images.</p>
<p>Call cravings.</p>
<p>And then on an apple.</p>
<p>We need to we need to fill that list of cravings.</p>
<p>Without images for the total number of foods basically.</p>
<p>Previous game so cravings cleared and will say.</p>
<p>Crave equals 0.</p>
<p>Will crave is less than food type.com.</p>
<p>Basically cravings.</p>
<p>Add.</p>
<p>Crave.</p>
<p>And an increments crave.</p>
<p>Add zero and.</p>
<p>Make this one and i'll say yeah one is less than the max add 1 and it'll go to 3 and 4 so what if this works correctly we should see the numbers 0 what I am 0 1 2 and 3 3 is the final eight because we count from 0 and we only have four food items at the moment.</p>
<p>Yep 4 crabbing 012 and 3 perfect then what we can do is we can shuffle at list.</p>
<p>I've asked chachi bts there's so many times actually isn't there a.</p>
<p>Function now on lists.</p>
<p>I think you need my other functions now that automatically shuffle is less than not sure.</p>
<p>Random.</p>
<p>Salt + 3 overlords.</p>
<p>No I don't think you can.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Alice chat dvd because it will knock something up for me really quick.</p>
<p>Pounds to shuffle this list of food cravings.</p>
<p>Order by x lambda r&g next function holy shit.</p>
<p>Cannot declare a variable of static type random.</p>
<p>Ok it might be because there are two randoms you see there's a unit the engine random.</p>
<p>And there's a system random I wonder if it's trying to use system random.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ok I didn't make that clear.</p>
<p>It's a good job by noah enough to.</p>
<p>Since using system random rather than unity engine.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the player will put a little thought bubble above payments head with the food icon in that she wants and then if you send her that specific food you'll get your score extra points.</p>
<p>I love this I think it's a really cool.</p>
<p>Pizza.</p>
<p>Freeze then pizza.</p>
<p>Shuffle order which is great.</p>
<p>So what we want to do now.</p>
<p>Is we want to go get a thought bubble.</p>
<p>The telegraph to the player what she's craving.</p>
<p>That's interesting.</p>
<p>Shade all over it.</p>
<p>Make it pink.</p>
<p>I like that one.</p>
<p>Will flip out.</p>
<p>New image.</p>
<p>List and philippines.</p>
<p>Horizontal.</p>
<p>You want to get rid of the backgrounds.</p>
<p>Delete the background.</p>
<p>And make the background invisible there we go that should be nice we can also invert that selection and crop it a little tighter.</p>
<p>This must be ours.</p>
<p>Match 3 sound.</p>
<p>3 ui so let's just grab that address and we'll call it.</p>
<p>Alright so how are we going to set this up i'm glad you didn't ask so what we're gonna do is we're going to make a new object which will call craving.</p>
<p>Component.</p>
<p>Set a note of size there we go and if we go into our scene view.</p>
<p>Open down so I would like it if the bubble floated up and down with her otherwise the bubbles kind of static and she's bouncing up and down i'm going to look a bit weird so if we stick the will stick the craving onto pine on so as she's floating up and down the bubble follows her basically.</p>
<p>Is it going to display the craved item.</p>
<p>That's this is so funny.</p>
<p>I want burger.</p>
<p>This is so funny ok so we'll call this.</p>
<p>Food crab.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>As a few ways we can go about doing this.</p>
<p>Go into the card.</p>
<p>And what will do is we'll make it a state machine.</p>
<p>Basically means.</p>
<p>It's going to.</p>
<p>Which basically means it's going to be driven by an integer.</p>
<p>Sour integer is obviously going to be.</p>
<p>Current.</p>
<p>Crab.</p>
<p>So essentially will enable the crave.</p>
<p>There's a few ways we could we could go about doing this.</p>
<p>Ok i'll show you the best way to do it.</p>
<p>The best way to do it.</p>
<p>The reason why is once you start adding more of these systems if because the easiest way to do it is to make a public list of food and then drug the food across right which is how you can it's hot how to do it but as soon as I learnt I do things dynamically it's so much easier because.</p>
<p>How long run because if I wanted to add 6 more food items right now and then i've got to update the food database and then i've got to update a craving system and then i've got to update the food squares i've got to update the grids i've got to update every fucking thing and it's just like you know that can be a lot of work but if you make these things literally dynamically find themselves then you can literally say look he is where my food lives go and find out what food there isn't gone phil you you know fill yourself up with that and that's just so much easier because it'll just happened automatically so that's what we're going to do so we're going to link the food parent.</p>
<p>And then all we need to do is have a private list now.</p>
<p>And the list is of food types of we look at our food we using a food square type.</p>
<p>So we want a list of food squares.</p>
<p>Which we're going to call.</p>
<p>Foods equals new leicester food squares.</p>
<p>For each.</p>
<p>Food square.</p>
<p>Food in food parents.</p>
<p>Transform.</p>
<p>So essentially we say for each transform.</p>
<p>Child in food parent.</p>
<p>Add.</p>
<p>Child.</p>
<p>Food square.</p>
<p>Find all the children of this parent game object and go and get the food type components the custom class food type for each one and add it into our list of food types that way if I had 60 more food types I don't have to update anything.</p>
<p>An essentially what we can do is.</p>
<p>Types and grab the.</p>
<p>From that food and then place it onto the image components of alberta thing here right so what we need to do is first reference this we could even do this.</p>
<p>Food craving.</p>
<p>Food crab we called it so I like to keep things consistent.</p>
<p>Raw image food crab last name of our class so we can't have it.</p>
<p>Food crab image and then we can serve food curve image.</p>
<p>Equals transform.</p>
<p>Find food crab.</p>
<p>When we can do is we can say ok we want to set.</p>
<p>Image to whatever food types is currently craving so where we do that is we say.</p>
<p>Food cravings.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>Index.</p>
<p>Crave.</p>
<p>Starts.</p>
<p>And then get the food and I actually called it food image I believe.</p>
<p>Stars all the textures of all the foods.</p>
<p>Ok so that should work so we can test that.</p>
<p>Somebody fault you shouldn't be craving anything right because that happens later so turn it off by default also food parents we need to make sure that's set so we'll just tell it where our food lives and then that's all it needs to know.</p>
<p>This is the index of the food not the.</p>
<p>Enable it.</p>
<p>Stuff.</p>
<p>Can I get a manager we need to.</p>
<p>About it.</p>
<p>So we'll make a public game objects.</p>
<p>Actually we can link it is the time it's better to link as a type.</p>
<p>Type.</p>
<p>Right now I like that it does.</p>
<p>Leaving everything.</p>
<p>I could have written down like you know the whole streets credit card numbers because I was taking payments or whatever you know I mean for my night-time services I meant I mean the plushies are ordered for them on behalf of them and you know what I mean and I could have left that on my notepad and then i'm streaming live and I open my notepad and oh shit I just docked everybody's credit card number.</p>
<p>Anywhere right so we said.</p>
<p>At intervals.</p>
<p>At intervals 258 and 11 these when these moves are remaining.</p>
<p>So what we do is we look at when moves get adjusted right.</p>
<p>So we're looking for a number of moves.</p>
<p>And I will start that I said yeah I need to change that to 12.</p>
<p>Ok so this is where the number of moves is.</p>
<p>Ok so what we could do is actually just make a new.</p>
<p>Let's see if there's a way to do this.</p>
<p>Add gbt can see my syntax in my variables so i'm just going to say if number of moves = 2 then.</p>
<p>Current crab.</p>
<p>Pause cravings.</p>
<p>How can i.</p>
<p>Ok let's see what it says.</p>
<p>Specific moves 258 and 11 to the corresponding index is 0 1 2 3 you can generalise the logic by using a mapping between the move numbers and the cravings list this way you avoid hard coding each case.</p>
<p>Stop ok so we generate an array of integers with craving moves that's cool.</p>
<p>Which we can type in there.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Can determine oh that's cool and then we basically get the craving index by analysing that a rare to say ok.</p>
<p>Tell can't move and where does it lie in.</p>
<p>But you've got to be very narrow with you.</p>
<p>Play narrow with your side of questions random is ambiguous between random.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Ok so for all the other random.</p>
<p>Random.</p>
<p>Now it needs to know because we've also used system random so that makes sense.</p>
<p>It took a while to flag that but ok.</p>
<p>Equals cravings at craving index foodcraft.</p>
<p>Game object object to true.</p>
<p>So let's see if it works.</p>
<p>Now at the moment all we're doing is telegraphing this is important are we doing is telegraphing the cravings to the player we're not actually applying any scar bonus to the play yet.</p>
<p>Looking right and then the scoring is easy.</p>
<p>Let's see if it works on the next move I should make one move and then she should instantly start crabbing something random.</p>
<p>Yep french fries.</p>
<p>I guess I get extra points for.</p>
<p>Give me a french fries.</p>
<p>Craving on the next move.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>Keep playing.</p>
<p>I might change those numbers that I feel like her second move craving is a little early.</p>
<p>All right well thanks for joining me and I will see you around ok.</p>
<p>This feels really good to be fair i'm not sure my only complaint is I feel like I feel like a craving on the second move feels a little bit early.</p>
<p>Yeah seems really good I mean -1 moves right now though so yeah couple of things we need to do obviously we need to like you know give give an end of game.</p>
<p>Yes feels really good again I don't know about the second by the second move she's already craving something specific might feel a little early.</p>
<p>Also we managed to gain an extra moose so now we're on move 13.</p>
<p>Ok so in my testing I found a bug.</p>
<p>So on move 13 she's craving a drink.</p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Ok so the way we fix that is we can say.</p>
<p>I feel like that comes a little bit too early.</p>
<p>Raise.</p>
<p>I switch cravings off when not applicable.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Claire gets extra moves.</p>
<p>Big points.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Cravings are on.</p>
<p>If the player.</p>
<p>Where's moves.</p>
<p>Become.</p>
<p>Higher than the starting.</p>
<p>Moves off 12.</p>
<p>Oh yeah goes backwards doesn't it of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's here I actually wanted to do the.</p>
<p>We'll see how that feels.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if we can get some time on noises.</p>
<p>If I could find some time on noises like that ooh tasty traveller or something like that and just have a like say them at certain points that would be really cool.</p>
<p>I feel like that would be.</p>
<p>Hard to dig up the i'd like to specific.</p>
<p>You're in the sims absolutely fine i'm actually really pleased with it.</p>
<p>I think now we just need to do two things we need to do.</p>
<p>What's the score multiplier to the player when she's when you give her the craved food.</p>
<p>And then like told the score up and.</p>
<p>Ensure the final score when we run out of moves.</p>
<p>Yeah I need to also make sure that when we run out of moves.</p>
<p>I feel like I need to wait for the food to finish dropping before we display the sort of game of a screen otherwise it's going to be I feel like it's going to happen too soon it's going to be too abroad.</p>
<p>What's the easiest way to do this actually.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Craving is applied we tell the this is photographing right we tell the players telegraphing system to telegraph to the player that you know.</p>
<p>A private which is current career.</p>
<p>If the current career value is negative one it means she's not craving anything.</p>
<p>If the current.</p>
<p>As a value greater than -1 that will be the thing that she's craving.</p>
<p>We can say current crab =.</p>
<p>Living index.</p>
<p>Cravings at craving index.</p>
<p>And then here we can say current crab.</p>
<p>Eagles -1 and then back to our scoring system so if we go to.</p>
<p>I see called it hunger.</p>
<p>Wait so here's where we do our calculations.</p>
<p>3 + 3 x 80 amount that was above 3.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I'm so.</p>
<p>Number of moves equals number of moves + any value that we scored above 3 yeah that makes sense so what i'm essentially what I essentially do is if you match three.</p>
<p>Or less.</p>
<p>Add any more to the moves in the moves is going down by one each time anywhere but that means for four you get one extra move for five you get two extra moves if you managed to much sex you get three extra moves which is great.</p>
<p>Ok so what we're going to need to do here at the moment.</p>
<p>Is our score calculator right and we apply it directly to the score which is a problem.</p>
<p>So what we do is we basically say.</p>
<p>Let's call it current.</p>
<p>The final part of the equation.</p>
<p>Right so you get 3 points minimum of.</p>
<p>3 + 3 x 5 how many times you scar above 3.</p>
<p>And then no hunger becomes.</p>
<p>No hunger plus current points that we scored so this tells us how much we scored this round here now we can say specifically.</p>
<p>If the food type if there is a craving so first condition is if cravings.</p>
<p>Create a -1.</p>
<p>If current crab is greater than -1 and our next condition wants to be and the food that was marched is the craved food now this is interesting because I don't know if i'm making a note of what food specifically is being marched I don't think I do it the moment cuz my system need to know that.</p>
<p>But we do have a match in the exponent.</p>
<p>So we can find out what was marched.</p>
<p>Am I deaf or here I hear.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Scale haq death here.</p>
<p>I do have subtitles though which is quite cool that I programmed.</p>
<p>So current craving is greater than -1.</p>
<p>But yeah I thought it'd be really cool to have sub.</p>
<p>Because my ai.</p>
<p>Used as them as well.</p>
<p>And I thought well if anybody you know does have hearing.</p>
<p>Shoes that would be really useful for them.</p>
<p>Do you have an index of where the matches so you can check directly against the vast.</p>
<p>How to check account.</p>
<p>Hitchcock is the list.</p>
<p>How much index is 0.</p>
<p>So we could look at h check at march index.</p>
<p>So h check at march index.</p>
<p>Give us.</p>
<p>The march was in so what we can do is we can say.</p>
<p>Add grid cells.</p>
<p>Add that position.</p>
<p>Good item.</p>
<p>Is also the same as the currently craved item.</p>
<p>So I think we should just double the current points like double points current points equals current points x 2.</p>
<p>Right to make sure that's working.</p>
<p>Double points.</p>
<p>Boarded for craving.</p>
<p>Hello how are you lots of underscores today.</p>
<p>Lots of underscores cool though they're very useful.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>So I programmed it myself actually so it's like speech recognition.</p>
<p>And I use it for my ai.</p>
<p>So that he can understand what i'm saying.</p>
<p>So he basically looks at that text and we sent that to chat gpt.</p>
<p>And he'll react off of that and I was like will it be cool to show that anywhere.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>How are you.</p>
<p>I am sinking in the chord.</p>
<p>End conversation.</p>
<p>Yes I got so he can react to my voice which is cool.</p>
<p>You can actually you can actually talk to him too so in chat if you just start a message with app boo you can talk to him as well.</p>
<p>And he'll respond to you.</p>
<p>Do we know that.</p>
<p>True and they eat everything all they want to eat everything much is so we need to add this to horizontal matches now.</p>
<p>Ok so we need to look at our score again.</p>
<p>Prove it to me.</p>
<p>Ok so once again we'll say in current score and it's going to equal this here then we can send number equals number hunger plus current score.</p>
<p>Is greater than -1.</p>
<p>What's the craving is correct I actually put current points.</p>
<p>Alright I will warn you if you keep.</p>
<p>I'm trying to work on this.</p>
<p>So please don't spam the chat bars if you don't mind.</p>
<p>Ok current score is 3 + 3 x the number that we've got above 3 if current cravings is greater than -1 it means something's been craved check to see if that thing is that's been crafted is the thing that was marched if so double the current score.</p>
<p>An addict.</p>
<p>If you do use a lot of emoji can.</p>
<p>He does a lot of things he actually he can translate he can read the screen he can read out the screen so I can read subtitles while i'm playing games he can read foreign subtitles and translate them for me you can actually translate in real time because it does all kinds of stuff is pretty cool he can do it google search I can get it to look something up on the internet.</p>
<p>I've been in a game and i've you know asked how do I don't know upgrade this specific thing and i'm playing and he'll tell me.</p>
<p>Yeah they can do sometimes.</p>
<p>Set a plug-in that I use that I actually paid for actually bought it on the uniti star but it's it's not so great you know the interesting thing about that plug-in is the way it works.</p>
<p>How google says they're not recording you and.</p>
<p>Listening to you well the plug-in is actually using google chrome.</p>
<p>So everything you're saying now is actually coming from google chrome cuz google chrome has speech recognition built into it.</p>
<p>If they're not listening to you then why why do they have speech recognition built into the web browser.</p>
<p>Yes they're definitely listening.</p>
<p>So that's how he does what he does we're actually using google's google chrome speech recognition system and feeding that into uni.</p>
<p>I was only cheap I don't spend too much on my assets.</p>
<p>What should happen now she should crave the food.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on console and if we give it the food that she was specifically craving we should get double points on that.</p>
<p>Let's do the fries.</p>
<p>Oh we got an index out of range.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>Oh I know why.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Yeah so what I what I want to start doing is so i've been making games in unity for years and years so what i'm basically doing now is I love genshin impact so and I love these like games and they they have a lot of like mini games and stuff in their event right so as part of my new thing now is every time I find a mini game that I like in the game and we're playing it on stream i'll be like ok we're gonna we're going to remake this so I meant I remade finch ball so if you go to my website.</p>
<p>And you will play games finch ball.</p>
<p>Are we made fish bowl recently.</p>
<p>Distance from genshin's latest event.</p>
<p>And so yeah we play we play the mini games and then we're like ok let's let's see if we can remake this and so that's why i'm doing much three now cos they had much streakers there's much three ones being really tricky though it's it's been a lot harder than I thought it would be.</p>
<p>On my github.</p>
<p>And you can download the projects as the finish bowl on there so you can actually just download this and and get it in unity and say how it works or follow the tutorials whatever you want.</p>
<p>I know i'm required to use two factor authentication.</p>
<p>Ok now she's craving fries.</p>
<p>But we got the double points for the fries one move early.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Now why is that.</p>
<p>So I can only assume the reason why that happened is because.</p>
<p>We set the craving volume before the scarring had finished on the previous move.</p>
<p>So that's a problem so it'll be interesting to see whether we get the double points now for the freeze on our.</p>
<p>Ok so we got double points for craving.</p>
<p>One move too early.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>I wonder I wonder if the telegraphing is one behind.</p>
<p>It's possible that the telegraphing is one behind.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Where is my check cravings where has it gone there it is.</p>
<p>So what i'm going to do just to test that i'm going to redefine the cravings one earlier.</p>
<p>But if it's still but then again this drives this drives the craving notifying as well right.</p>
<p>Site on really think that's gonna work.</p>
<p>Holy shit I got a lot of matches.</p>
<p>Ok now she's saying chris fries.</p>
<p>We gave a freeze but we didn't get double points.</p>
<p>She's saying crave pizza.</p>
<p>Ok this is very strange.</p>
<p>Let's test it again with its original logic.</p>
<p>Ok let's.</p>
<p>I think what it may be.</p>
<p>I should be fine though.</p>
<p>Is she supposed to be craving at 7.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ok let's see that again what the hell went wrong.</p>
<p>Ok moves 11 is she meant to be craving.</p>
<p>Yes she's not meant to be craving it moves 11.</p>
<p>That's the first issue.</p>
<p>I think what I think I know what it is ok I know what it is it's because when were you award the player additional moves.</p>
<p>We're not we're not checking for cravings we're not running this check cravings ok that makes sense so ok I know why.</p>
<p>Call just says number of moves where is that.</p>
<p>Yeah number of moves equals itself + anything we scored above 3.</p>
<p>So what we could do is we could say.</p>
<p>Above 3 is greater than zero.</p>
<p>Check cravings.</p>
<p>Pick a number of movies would have changed.</p>
<p>Craving it moves 10 isn't she.</p>
<p>Show me the crabbing.</p>
<p>Yes she is ok that's good.</p>
<p>We didn't.</p>
<p>Something is still very wrong.</p>
<p>Ok so the first thing I need to know so what one side of this isn't working and I need to know which side it is.</p>
<p>So now play matches.</p>
<p>We do it all as one.</p>
<p>I am going to paste it above and mute.</p>
<p>And then i'm just going to make this condition if current cravings is greater than -1 what that will allow me to do is just see whether she's actually craving we need to make sure we're scaring at the right moment essentially.</p>
<p>Answer if we're not it's obviously not going to work we need to fix that.</p>
<p>Here as well.</p>
<p>So now I expect to see double points awarded for craving whenever she's craving regardless of what she gets just so that we know that it's running at the right time.</p>
<p>Cos I don't know that it is.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Ok double points awarded for craving.</p>
<p>I think what might be happening is.</p>
<p>Wake up like we reduce the moves yeah I think we do I think we reduce the moves first.</p>
<p>She didn't.</p>
<p>So she's she's awarding double points one move to early I think I know why.</p>
<p>Ok so the reason why.</p>
<p>I think I know why.</p>
<p>Ok let me see what happens i'm going to take check cravings out.</p>
<p>I don't think we want to update the cravings as the moves been made because the essentially is the moves been made it's not necessarily the end of the movie that makes sense.</p>
<p>Is the food drops it can find new matches right so when the players finishing their move that isn't necessarily the end of the move.</p>
<p>I think this is why it's not working as doing it too early.</p>
<p>So we want we want to put that back in.</p>
<p>Take that out.</p>
<p>And I think what we want to do is regardless of whether it's above 3 or not we just want to check cravings.</p>
<p>That way because what were essentially doing is.</p>
<p>Now you know what it is right we need ok i'm also we need to check cravings after we've done the score multiplier I think that's what it is we're checking the cravings before we do the skull multiplier so by the time.</p>
<p>By the time it comes back.</p>
<p>And we do the scarring it's no long like she's she's no longer got that craving value.</p>
<p>Cast try that.</p>
<p>And for that one it's already set like that so that should be fine.</p>
<p>Ok let's try that.</p>
<p>Bright so now she's supposed to be craving pizza.</p>
<p>There we go double points for craving pizza.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>And actually put the.</p>
<p>The other side of the equation as well that's wrong which is it's not identifying that the food was the food that she was actually craving so to tests we need to give us something she's craving when she's craving and some and give us something else when she's grabbing and see what happens.</p>
<p>So we can give a drinks and we should see double points.</p>
<p>Let's give us something else.</p>
<p>Let's give a pizza.</p>
<p>She shouldn't get double points for this pizza.</p>
<p>I've got two notifications right now.</p>
<p>Yep she didn't.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Yeah it's working perfectly.</p>
<p>Start out.</p>
<p>Ok so next thing we want to do is.</p>
<p>Identify when the number of moves as reach 0 and the final food has dropped.</p>
<p>But we need some interface.</p>
<p>And for now i'm quite literally i'm just going to say.</p>
<p>And I will do like a play again or whatever.</p>
<p>End game for now i'm going to set this up.</p>
<p>So I want to reference this.</p>
<p>We want.</p>
<p>That's kind of weird.</p>
<p>To recheck equals true.</p>
<p>Set a recheck.</p>
<p>How do I know when it's finished.</p>
<p>Essentially we set do recheck to false there.</p>
<p>I think we could just do it here right so I think I think we should say here if number of moves.</p>
<p>Is zero.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Change matches.</p>
<p>Hitchcock isn't that.</p>
<p>And here to check count is absolute zero and vtec count is absolute zero.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>Endgame.</p>
<p>Set active.</p>
<p>So let's test that.</p>
<p>So that will be just disappeared for now.</p>
<p>Finalise everything.</p>
<p>And then the end game notification should come up.</p>
<p>You want to drink time on.</p>
<p>I can give you a drink.</p>
<p>I can play a different sound effect for like double points will get it up.</p>
<p>Bonus.</p>
<p>Turn it up moves.</p>
<p>It finished it's march it did not it did not show the game end screen.</p>
<p>Interesting so that didn't work at all did it.</p>
<p>Why is that if.</p>
<p>And there were no matches horizontally and there were no matches vertically.</p>
<p>Then go ahead and show the end again screen that makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Ok so what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>So basically we'll say we drop the food after marches.</p>
<p>14 only if we haven't reached the end of the game.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Youtube at least youtube chats working again.</p>
<p>5.0.</p>
<p>I know you can do.</p>
<p>In the meantime you can play hungry hungry time on completely for free in a few hours because we'll be building this out to the website so you've got to play compiled dot calm.</p>
<p>Play games on google play.</p>
<p>And you can feed time on.</p>
<p>And score points.</p>
<p>Almost done.</p>
<p>And there's also finch ball on there.</p>
<p>Beautiful I like the craving thing I think that's a nice touch okay she wants pizza.</p>
<p>Yes or it's both so.</p>
<p>Call my games you can download the card so I got my website and i'll show you it's not finished yet the website but just to give you an idea.</p>
<p>Does three versions of the game.</p>
<p>If you go to the github there's.</p>
<p>What can I add to it do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Game downloads is I haven't done this yet but you'll be able to download and install the game if you just want to run it on pc from here or if you got to play games you can play them on the website itself so here's the finished ball one so you can just play finch ball in the web browser yeah I need to fix this it's like the physics are all over the place it shouldn't bounce off that.</p>
<p>My cards good.</p>
<p>I will look at that but you know we're starting out we'll get there but yeah hunger hunger time on will be here.</p>
<p>So yeah that'll be fun.</p>

<p>Unity game engine.</p>
<p>C sharp.</p>
<p>Yeah it's taking me quite a while this one has been a real pen it's like I did not expect this to be so difficult but as you can see I finally got it work and it's it's working.</p>
<p>Stop the play from being sneaky and trying to do stuff in the background although it looks like what happens when this game over screen shows up you can see it stops you from interacting.</p>
<p>Yeah you shouldn't be you should be allowed to do that but anyway.</p>
<p>Will fix that.</p>
<p>You don't know you don't know you need yeah it's a it took me a long time but yeah I offer I offer free resources tutorials if you want to if you ever want to learn some of these projects are a bit much even for me so I wouldn't expect new users to.</p>
<p>Make a smaller version of something that i'm doing.</p>
<p>I need to find better things for beginners I think.</p>
<p>But yeah.</p>
<p>That is what I do.</p>
<p>Yes they get the game of the screen is is working we just need to make that look pretty now yeah then we're done we're done basically so let's make sure we update the score so the two things that I think we should do.</p>
<p>Set alarm for a couple of weeks I then realised that was actually a unity bug so that wasn't even my fault and as I was as I was deciding I wanted these things on a website and I moved down to a previous version.</p>
<p>2015 hours.</p>
<p>Turn that alarm.</p>
<p>Yes or ask some when I came back to it and I went down a unit version I realised it was actually unity bugs i've been working on it now for a but another week I think so has been a few weeks of work this.</p>
<p>You have no idea how much work goes into these things.</p>
<p>1050 lines of code.</p>
<p>Which is crazy right.</p>
<p>Yeah this this has been a tricky one i'll be honest this is quite a tricky one but i'm really glad i've actually managed to do it I think this is really really cool actually.</p>
<p>Foods anywhere in a match 3 and I have actually thoroughly enjoyed testing this today it's nice to see it finally come together.</p>
<p>But that's why I do it right like that's the joy comes from seeing it for me at least the joy comes from seeing it all come together and being like ok this this feels like a game now I can play I can interact with it it does stuff and it's and I did this and it does nothing like it.</p>
<p>I need to stop the player from moving I also need to update the score.</p>
<p>So we called it endgame.</p>
<p>Tell endgame score so let's go and find that.</p>
<p>Obviously we're going to make this look better.</p>
<p>Now final score.</p>
<p>If I take and show you something pretty cool right now I like to do this.</p>
<p>Txt score is the object that will.</p>
<p>Endgame.</p>
<p>Transform find txt score.</p>
<p>Get components.</p>
<p>Text.</p>
<p>Duct text equals.</p>
<p>We actually called.</p>
<p>Numb hunger.</p>
<p>Two string.</p>
<p>Let's do something cool if you got a cool text I really like this website if you got a cooltext.com.</p>
<p>You can find some pretty looking texts.</p>
<p>Ballerina.</p>
<p>And you can type whatever the hell you want.</p>
<p>Final score.</p>
<p>And you can make some pretty nice looking text just to you know for free you can just stick where everyone can change the colours and stuff everyone that looks fine to me it's just a bit more interesting than playing text ryan.</p>
<p>If we download that.</p>
<p>Have we got a file called cool text bloody bloody blah.</p>
<p>Sensible name.</p>
<p>Like final score.</p>
<p>I forgot to our projects.</p>
<p>We've got ui.</p>
<p>Downloads.</p>
<p>Final score.</p>
<p>That looks so much better.</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>Cooltext.com.</p>
<p>We can find something else.</p>
<p>Sing a bit more plane not too crazy but you can change the fonts and this is well so if you don't like the font so you might like an effect right so like I don't know like this one for example I like the effect but I don't necessarily like the font so we can go in and we can click the font which is cooper and then they're all categorised let's go for fun fonts and then look at all these that we get.</p>
<p>I'm thinking like.</p>
<p>Not too thick you know.</p>
<p>But also not too serious.</p>
<p>We don't want to be wuthering words.</p>
<p>So we can say play again.</p>
<p>Oh I like that.</p>
<p>170 there we go.</p>
<p>Download.</p>
<p>Play again.</p>
<p>Drag that into our ui elements.</p>
<p>Play again.</p>
<p>Honestly more trouble than it's worth this text message bro that is a gigantic button.</p>
<p>That's a scary ass button that I don't want to I want to fuck with a button that big.</p>
<p>Intimidating.</p>
<p>Replay.</p>
<p>For the build it's going to close your game basically or when when we put it all in a big mini game you know collection it'll send you back to like do you know pick what mini game you want to play screen or whatever so that one is replay that one's quit let's say so we got a button replay we got a button quit yeah now.</p>
<p>What is a bit it looks a bit awful so how do we fix that ok well.</p>
<p>It's because yeah.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I am back I think i'm gonna have to go again soon cuz I think.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>This logic.</p>
<p>So what we'll do is i'll make a script.</p>
<p>Call endgame.</p>
<p>If we use unity engine scene management than what we can do.</p>
<p>Is we can restart the game like restart the level.</p>
<p>Fcc yes.</p>
<p>Ok what you want to do.</p>
<p>Is mac.</p>
<p>One called button.</p>
<p>These are essentially listeners.</p>
<p>A public game object reference to but no.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>So what do you want to be doing is listening for these objects to become active.</p>
<p>Yes active self.</p>
<p>Is true.</p>
<p>Then we can do what we need to do here for restarting the game so this would basically be seen management.</p>
<p>Lord scene and you want to give it the scene string name as whatever the scenes called so you can check that if we got to build settings.</p>
<p>Add open scenes sourcing names much 3 with a capital m.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>Active self.</p>
<p>Is true.</p>
<p>Whether it's going to be inside of a compilation of games run.</p>
<p>New mini games.</p>
<p>And for an hour's going to call 01 select folder save.</p>
<p>There's a few things I need to do for this though because essentially like.</p>
<p>What we're doing is we're building the mini games inside of a big mini game compilation as like child games if you like and then when i'm doing the tutorial projects and the individual bills like if you just want to play match 3 all day you shouldn't need to download.</p>
<p>So then i'm going to funnel out the single mini game into a single project and then we build that as like an independent project.</p>
<p>Building but I just kind of thought let's get the directory structure.</p>
<p>Good lord.</p>
<p>Be for a while.</p>
<p>Close this we want to that would probably build fine actually if we.</p>
<p>Disable one of the things we need to do.</p>
<p>I forgot about yes.</p>
<p>And on the buttons themselves you'll have a thing here that says on click.</p>
<p>Replay.</p>
<p>Link button yes and say game ok.</p>
<p>And then I record will pick up on the fact that that button there might be better ways of doing buttons I don't know that's the best way i've found to do it.</p>
<p>Ok that should be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah so that should be fine so I give it a quick test playthrough first.</p>
<p>And we could add additional sound effects and.</p>
<p>Yes or no.</p>
<p>Listen to add more sound effects or any more mechanic spot for now i'm just going to get out and get out there like we can always come back to some of these projects in the future and then like you know.</p>
<p>Expand on them.</p>
<p>Really I should be stopping the play from trying to play the game while it's playing itself.</p>
<p>But yeah really it's like I should be stopping.</p>
<p>This is a good run.</p>
<p>Already i've got six moves left.</p>
<p>Get me really start to look more than anything else there is a little bit of skill involved.</p>
<p>Do you want to go ahead and fix that not right now.</p>
<p>198 ok that's a pretty good score.</p>
<p>Ok can we can we beat 200.</p>
<p>Can we beat 200.</p>
<p>That is the number to bees.</p>
<p>200.</p>
<p>Things at the top before.</p>
<p>This is actually surprisingly fun i'm not going to lie like i'm actually every time i've tested this game so far i've actually enjoy planner.</p>
<p>Which kind of weird.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I need some like match fours.</p>
<p>That's what I need.</p>
<p>Yeah how did I score 200 on that run I must have got lucky.</p>
<p>156 someone got two moves left or.</p>
<p>Cnn.</p>
<p>Holy shit.</p>
<p>Look 238 challenge you to beat that.</p>
<p>230.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Bye for now.</p>
<p>Hungry hungry poem on is finished.</p>
<p>Make sure all looks good.</p>
<p>That's strange.</p>
<p>I might need to look at that.</p>
<p>We did on a couple of them.</p>
<p>But now we're not seeing the food at all are we did that with pizza slices.</p>
<p>Ok the drinks went over that's really weird I wonder why sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>Moses refresh it and see if it's like.</p>
<p>I don't even know how you debug a web build really because where do you like dump your outputs to have an idea.</p>
<p>Yeah we're not seeing the food on this version that's really weird.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do and then sometimes we don't most of the time we don't i'm wondering is it a certain type of food that is the only food that you're not burgers went across.</p>
<p>The freeze didn't but those freeze did that's really weird.</p>
<p>That's kind of disappointing I don't know why that is.</p>
<p>Time on.</p>
<p>It seems to be like inconsistent which is weird.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why that is.</p>
<p>Isn't it the.</p>
<p>Sharky or whatever she's called.</p>
<p>Yeah the game please find at least.</p>
<p>189 i'm going pretty well.</p>
<p>I've just beat my top score in the web browser.</p>
<p>249 not bad though.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>Uploaded today.</p>
<p>The builds are going to take a while the pc builds you have to bare with me.</p>
<p>And is pc boo fixed now can we get rid of that annoying debug text at the top.</p>
<p>Seems to be he's been running for like 4 hours at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>He seems to be better we'll really like this for adele too and I can get rid of that debug text if everything looks good but yeah I think I fixed it looks like youtube.</p>
<p>Fixed pc boos bogs.</p>
<p>And finished hungry hungry pie mum.</p>
<p>Last night.</p>
<p>Yeah and I don't know if i'm going to get robbed in anything else we'll see but i'll probably be back on in an hour or so.</p>
<p>Stream to sort of deploy all this and get it on the website and everything.</p>
<p>But you're pretty i'm pretty happy with that.</p>
<p>I wanted to see I want to see it's ex build.</p>
<p>I was going to say just in case that breaks anything but it's not entirely.</p>
<p>Error free right now from being honest.</p>
<p>Certainly not.</p>
<p>Just a little bit.</p>
<p>Would be better.</p>
<p>Windows build 64 base.</p>
<p>Switch platform.</p>
<p>So I guess unity is handling all of that in the in the background.</p>
<p>Set platforms can handle certain things and not other things.</p>
<p>This will be my first time seeing it in full full screen.</p>
<p>Add a really quickly.</p>
<p>Ok yeah it looks good.</p>
<p>And we see the food.</p>
<p>Some weird issue.</p>
<p>Ok there's some weird issue when it comes to.</p>
<p>Yeah I think that's what it might be you know.</p>
<p>That's a bug.</p>
<p>What is it that my is it the things not active what we can do is say get object.</p>
<p>Set active to true see if that fixes that.</p>
<p>What unit is doing as it's pooling objects.</p>
<p>Between the editor.</p>
<p>You're not no that doesn't make sense it can't be that though because.</p>
<p>The reason it can't be that is because the first set of food we didn't see.</p>
<p>Oh my god why I spent so long on this.</p>
<p>It doesn't ever seem to happen in the editor as well that's the thing.</p>
<p>It never happens in the editor.</p>
<p>I also don't know whether.</p>
<p>I don't know what the throws getting the object or not.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>System ir.</p>
<p>File.</p>
<p>Depend all text.</p>
<p>Build depot text.</p>
<p>Ok i'm glad that happened so we threw one set of stuff.</p>
<p>We didn't see it.</p>
<p>Not good because it does not supposed to happen but good because now if I check my there it is build debug.</p>
<p>Turn it down it received ok so it received three objects to throw.</p>
<p>So the throws receiving the objects.</p>
<p>We didn't see them.</p>
<p>Using global position.</p>
<p>Global position original position.</p>
<p>Local scale.</p>
<p>I have a weird feeling this is a this is some kind of weird position and she was saying.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>Position.</p>
<p>Is local position.</p>
<p>I just have a capital p interesting.</p>
<p>I also want to know.</p>
<p>As it throws.</p>
<p>In a debug.</p>
<p>No not so any object.</p>
<p>Different.</p>
<p>But that would suggest that the.</p>
<p>Where the hell do we set destination.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Local position equals destination.</p>
<p>Weather forecast destination.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Start currency rate destination transform position.</p>
<p>Oh my god why unity.</p>
<p>And now we're not seeing stuff again which is weird.</p>
<p>Weird unpredictable results when we change.</p>
<p>Position the local position.</p>
<p>Local position anywhere.</p>
<p>But we added.</p>
<p>I'm bastard.</p>
<p>I still think that the issue is something to do with the position of the thing.</p>
<p>The objects dart transform dot position.to string.</p>
<p>Right so that should have fixed the issue in the editor.</p>
<p>Drive me insane.</p>
<p>Set a might have something to do with different screen sizes is normally the case right so the first set of objects.</p>
<p>The first match and set of objects.</p>
<p>Add weren't visible but then every set of objects after that we're so let's take a look at the debug.</p>
<p>That will be from a previous run.</p>
<p>I mean I don't see anything weird.</p>
<p>First objects.</p>
<p>Right we didn't get any the first set we didn't see the second set we did the third set we didn't see.</p>
<p>It's not a position issue.</p>
<p>Right let's keep testing.</p>
<p>Give me my fucking mouse.</p>
<p>I need to differentiate between the ones we can see and the ones we can't see i'm trying to figure out what the fucking differences right so those ones those french fries.</p>
<p>These were all visible.</p>
<p>Does what all visible.</p>
<p>And so all of those.</p>
<p>Race can we have some that aren't visible then so we can see the fucking difference.</p>
<p>Yeah something went wrong there that something in this lot didn't show.</p>
<p>The positions look good to me.</p>
<p>I don't know I mean we haven't seen.</p>
<p>A position starting at 856.</p>
<p>I don't even think it's a position issue I don't know what it is I will foods ready i'm going to go and get that.</p>
<p>See you later bye.</p>
<p>Yeah I just I don't really fuck.</p>
<p>Stand why.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a position problem.</p>
<p>Sorry in the build.</p>
<p>So maybe they're getting their cell.</p>
<p>Waves.</p>
<p>I want you to getting their cells wipes.</p>
<p>Because we throw the we throw the cells.</p>
<p>I bet we're passing empty food sells tour.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>All right let's see if that fixes it.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Ok what i'm going to do is i'm going to do a public pool cute.</p>
<p>Equals false.</p>
<p>And then i'm going to go into game manager and i'm going to.</p>
<p>Cute.</p>
<p>Deals return new.</p>
<p>Seems fine.</p>
<p>Trentham bells.</p>
<p>Are we only did it for.</p>
<p>Am I actually work.</p>
<p>Yep it looks fine.</p>
<p>Yep perfect.</p>
<p>To go ahead and process all of its food objects.</p>
<p>Debug.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>Ok we fix the bugs.</p>
<p>We fix the bugs.</p>
<p>It's all working in a web.</p>
<p>I brilliant let's get it some.</p>
<p>Let's get on the website.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Build is actually the live build right now.</p>
<p>Just in case.</p>
<p>We'll just do a quick backup of everything.</p>
<p>You know me and backups.</p>
<p>So alive website is stored.</p>
<p>Documents.</p>
<p>We have a fault called finch ball.</p>
<p>Ok so the first thing i'm going to do is just delete everything in this folder.</p>
<p>So we can see the website.</p>
<p>What links from some bullshit so what i'm going to do is we're just going to work on the ht docs version.</p>
<p>Menu.</p>
<p>The menu funny enough.</p>
<p>All we need to do is firstly.</p>
<p>Change.</p>
<p>On the games.</p>
<p>Yeah so here's our drop down menu.</p>
<p>So we'll go to.</p>
<p>Hungry hungry time on.</p>
<p>Refresh.</p>
<p>So let's go to our.</p>
<p>Finch bowl.</p>
<p>Probably the best thing to do is just to copy because they're both.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>So i'm going to copy my finch ball which is already alive game and i'm just going to call it match three.</p>
<p>Template data and an index.</p>
<p>Ok so the index is.</p>
<p>Heavily modified version of what unity.</p>
<p>So if we go to our unity build.</p>
<p>Play about millions is like defunct now isn't adding.</p>
<p>So new minigames.</p>
<p>Builds.</p>
<p>It will contain.</p>
<p>Most of the code that we have for the finch ball but it's going to have some things that are different.</p>
<p>Obviously it's loading this.</p>
<p>Web.</p>
<p>Play compiles mini games.</p>
<p>So the first thing I think I changed the size yeah we change the size to 1190 by 700.</p>
<p>So let's.</p>
<p>Say it again 1190 by 700.</p>
<p>I think that's actually any advice.</p>
<p>Phone number correctly.</p>
<p>I could have swore it was any.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>See you see a lot of web sick stuff in here the reason you see webb 6 is that's what I built it out as the name of it was web 6.</p>
<p>Ok first thing's first.</p>
<p>Let's take our build folder which had our web.</p>
<p>Files in.</p>
<p>Finch bowl.</p>
<p>Wagon.</p>
<p>I'm in the building.</p>
<p>Go to.</p>
<p>Match threes got a build folder so essentially to add a template data.</p>
<p>Actually we want those two folders copying over we want build and temp.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Are they both have web oh that's interesting that might just work now then the boss.</p>
<p>I think it caused it whatever folder you put it in so because I put it in a folder called web.</p>
<p>It's cold everything web.</p>
<p>What's the web 6 was because it was my 6th the 10th to build it and get it running properly it took me a while to.</p>
<p>Essentially.</p>
<p>So i'm curious if I save that one now.</p>
<p>Just work.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>So there we go we did it.</p>
<p>So now we just want to commit this to the github so it goes live on the on the actual website.</p>
<p>So are we there.</p>
<p>Is we grab.</p>
<p>That was our build we're done with that now.</p>
<p>This is our live site here.</p>
<p>So essentially we update.</p>
<p>We had a new folder of match 3 and we update menu to html literally all we did.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>Commit to github.</p>
<p>Binary file has changed.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Push the origin.</p>
<p>And that's it that's all we do.</p>
<p>Only takes like.</p>
<p>Close zombie.</p>
<p>Close 4k video downloader.</p>
<p>Will you get hot duster open just for now just kisses any issues but yeah let's let's give it a test if we go to play compile dot calm.</p>
<p>We got to play games it hasn't updated yet.</p>
<p>Yeah I can't take it can take like I don't know a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>In real websites if you if using real web ports to actually doesn't it's like.</p>
<p>As soon as you upload the ftp file as long as you're not pulling a cash version down or a cash version of your own machine because there are two types of cash is right there cash is that start locally but if you use something like cloudflare.</p>
<p>Play also start delivering caches to people there we go hungry hungry piemonte is now an option on the play games so if we give it a click is it the live website.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I present to you.</p>
<p>It's not perfect ok to be honest food sometimes shakes when it shouldn't and food sometimes doesn't shake when it should I could fix it.</p>
<p>Where's mother little things but.</p>
<p>I think for now you know I think.</p>
<p>It's actually quite fun and if you don't believe me.</p>
<p>Challenge you to beat my top score of 20030 on my top score that was actually amazing I almost got 300 actually.</p>
<p>Set another test I can't double points for sorters.</p>
<p>Are you would want sort of time on what I literally can't match any right now.</p>
<p>Have some french fries instead.</p>
<p>Ok did you see burger something changed into a burger then as well there's definitely issues it's not perfect like I said maybe i'll revisit this at some point but for now.</p>
<p>High scores.</p>
<p>I don't see any high scores.</p>
<p>Why am I so bad at this game.</p>
<p>This looks promising.</p>
<p>How many can we give you that's the question.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>That's pathetic.</p>
<p>Yeah it's it's pretty pretty good as well it feels perfect for like in a browser like this.</p>
<p>I can actually feels really really.</p>
<p>I almost feels like it was made specifically for the browser even though it wasn't necessarily.</p>
<p>And we've got a full screen build for it as well.</p>
<p>Need to get this on the switch.</p>
<p>God damn boo.</p>
<p>Why am I so bad at this game.</p>
<p>I swear down this I was doing better than this before I was actually doing it live.</p>
<p>Without a six moves come we have to score at least 100.</p>
<p>Move back from at 5.</p>
<p>81 score it's looking up a little bit isn't it it's like a little bit better.</p>
<p>A little bit ok we got some extras there come on it's going to be a match for you somewhere right and I just blind I might just be blind.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that the food lies and shakes when it's not supposed to I can I can fix that so he's I think I could pick it so easily.</p>
<p>I need to put this behind me.</p>
<p>In many ways.</p>
<p>It's not bad.</p>
<p>Struggling to see a good.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Am I picker.</p>
<p>Hungry hungry primal is now live.</p>
<p>If you wish to play it.</p>
<p>Simply go to play compile dot calm.</p>
<p>In fact here like.</p>
<p>Give me the link.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I challenge you to beat my top score.</p>
<p>144.</p>
<p>I'm just solving problems left and right aren't i.</p>
<p>Play 150 respectable.</p>
<p>It's not amazing but it's respectable.</p>
<p>Awesome like that if you hold control a movie scroll wheel in and just zoom your website in look at that that actually looks crystal clear that looks actually better than it did.</p>
<p>Resume that because I think it was performing scaling and assumed out so if you if you zoom your website in look at that this isn't a freaking website actually.</p>
<p>That actually looks really good.</p>
<p>It looks amazing.</p>
<p>Play compile.</p>
<p>I need to fix that i'm gonna say.</p>
<p>That's a good one.</p>
<p>This might be game of the year you know.</p>
<p>Is my actually win game of the year it's surprisingly addictive.</p>
<p>I think we've had worse game of the earth than this.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>You gotta play it to know the you have to play to know so you probably watching this thing in here right he's made a match 3 game he thinks it's game of the year.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>Play prove me wrong.</p>
<p>Play it and when you you'll be sat there I made this thing so I should be sick I am actually sick of the side of this thing but I can't stop playing it.</p>
<p>So what does that tell you all right if anybody should be sick of this thing it should be me and yet I can't get enough.</p>
<p>How good the scammers right.</p>
<p>It's amazing right.</p>
<p>Scott 81 which is amazing.</p>
<p>Cravings.</p>
<p>Topeka if she comes up.</p>
<p>If she comes up with a thought bubble you sit in a sec.</p>
<p>And she's asking for something you get double points.</p>
<p>I've got a match for their that's a good one.</p>
<p>How about this.</p>
<p>How to get double points on that.</p>
<p>Yeah I did one direction if it would play i'm sure some mobile spotted can you maybe go can you bring up like a web view or something about.</p>
<p>What is ipad and stuff.</p>
<p>I guess not.</p>
<p>Oh there's a good one.</p>
<p>Trust you to find a way to not be able to play the game honestly.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that mobiles don't support webm to be honest.</p>
<p>Ok can we talk 200 cos 200 is a really good score in this.</p>
<p>Can I do a match for.</p>
<p>Dial do the I should have done yeah that's another bug write it generated a pizza slice underneath freeze that I was trying to knock down but hey.</p>
<p>Maybe i'll bug fixes at some point maybe I want we'll see.</p>
<p>Let's do four.</p>
<p>Do another four.</p>
<p>Three as a four.</p>
<p>05.</p>
<p>I hate 255 this might be my top score.</p>
<p>This might be my top scorer so far.</p>
<p>Make a count.</p>
<p>That's a very good score that is actually might be my new new.</p>
<p>That's pretty good.</p>
<p>Across in the web you click no.</p>
<p>Yeah that's cool.</p>
<p>What do you send me.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>The game is unplayable.</p>

<p>Only beating world by two free cash.</p>
<p>What three characters do you get in will you don't get any dear.</p>
<p>Who even cares.</p>
<p>You spend your life comparing everything.</p>
<p>You'll never be happy you know.</p>
<p>You're my last girlfriend had 3 mm more breast circumference than you.</p>
<p>Games are more than the sum of their parts like people well hopefully they are.</p>
<p>What does what does.</p>
<p>Is watershed to ma tash do you think.</p>
<p>The japanese mtashed immortality what does the heater here we talk about again giraffe.</p>
<p>Us is very peter win.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>I acquitted against you.</p>
<p>I quit.</p>
<p>It won't let me do everything in 10 seconds so I quit.</p>
<p>Why are you stop me from clearing everything in 10 seconds you must like hey.</p>
<p>Why don't you speed on this and then have nothing to do.</p>
<p>If you put a 50 box of boxes of chocolates in front of a dog and dogs aren't you supposed to eat chocolate.</p>
<p>Is my point right that dog will eat those chocolates.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>What is the what is the dog just.</p>
<p>Now i'm not saying the dog is evil.</p>
<p>You should stop marching.</p>
<p>What is the dog.</p>
<p>But the dog doesn't know you better.</p>
<p>If i'm allowed to play a game.</p>
<p>I am not dog.</p>
<p>I am that dog if you put if you put a game in front of me and you let me play it i'm going to play the fucking thing.</p>
<p>I don't care about sleep.</p>
<p>But then if i'm left with nothing to do.</p>
<p>And it's another 6 weeks before the next.</p>
<p>I don't know attractive female character comes out well.</p>
<p>Mine yeah but you know.</p>
<p>The velvets could have been like no.</p>
<p>Just slow down.</p>
<p>Both sides.</p>
<p>Where are they.</p>
<p>Let me out of.</p>
<p>You have to blow right in the face.</p>
<p>Besides.</p>
<p>Tell me what it is.</p>
<p>Can't jump in here that's what I mean it's inconsistent right so sometimes you have to jump.</p>
<p>In the game.</p>
<p>Select sometimes I forget that you can jump because you can't always jump.</p>
<p>And it's that little inconsistency just.</p>
<p>Dress up I want to play a dress up game not fucking 7-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Now do I like putting my gacha characters in nice outfits yeah but that's different.</p>
<p>Why why you always blow up.</p>
<p>Can I get moving at all.</p>
<p>Make your mtn.</p>
<p>I've heard of the tales franchise.</p>
<p>Yeah maybe I should put thinking about it whenever I play the side with actual.</p>
<p>Are the good characters to play.</p>
<p>Is that am I done i'm done.</p>
<p>Worth doing for the gems.</p>
<p>That's it that's all there is.</p>
<p>That's all there is.</p>
<p>Wait what.</p>
<p>Are expired or cheers mate.</p>
<p>I thought I used those.</p>
<p>The hell.</p>
<p>Why have I got an odd number.</p>
<p>The odd number that.</p>
<p>Has literally yet.</p>
<p>What is literally is.</p>
<p>I normally made actual just cause she's.</p>
<p>Are you there to be honest.</p>
<p>But I do like life life is probably my second choice I would say.</p>
<p>Yeah I keep meeting the builder but I just haven't got around to it yet.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever really tried all that much and it's weird because I do like actual shotgun so I feel like I probably like I probably wouldn't enjoy.</p>
<p>Is it loading or what.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Is it supposed to open the launcher there it is a long last took your time.</p>
<p>Took you dumb time.</p>
<p>Why am I so sleepy entitled some.</p>
<p>Sleepy sunday.</p>
<p>If you're having epileptic seizures blackouts what was it.</p>
<p>Strokes and fits you should probably stop playing I think you probably.</p>
<p>Turn at that point.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Ends up.</p>
<p>Like very turned left.</p>
<p>Make a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Which is annoying because.</p>
<p>What are you say to me.</p>
<p>Can you count the characters again.</p>
<p>Double drops don't care.</p>
<p>What I do care about.</p>
<p>Is commissions.</p>
<p>Is my ok first question am I is all my resin caps I think it is a condensed.</p>
<p>I don't know I didn't find me a tullamore yesterday just for use it or lose it kind of thing so I thought it might as well use it.</p>
<p>No check the resin.</p>
<p>Are we oh we can do another.</p>
<p>So how many condensed do I have.</p>
<p>4 so I got room for one more.</p>
<p>We still have our purple resin.</p>
<p>Because it doesn't expire for another.</p>
<p>I got 17.</p>
<p>Stream solvents.</p>
<p>That's so funny.</p>
<p>I like my teapot they're going to increase teapot load.</p>
<p>Ok where are my commissions at.</p>
<p>Where am I commissions.</p>
<p>In inazuma okay.</p>
<p>Go on then inazuma.</p>
<p>1956.</p>
<p>I remember those yesterday.</p>
<p>Set a reminder.</p>
<p>Have a commission lake avenue reputation in your back garden.</p>
<p>Is it really dead.</p>
<p>Was that one of them did that work one of I remember this one you supposed to iron them.</p>
<p>You supposed to sneaky sneaky get the supplies you're not supposed to kill them.</p>
<p>Oops well you know whatever works right whatever works.</p>
<p>I thought I felt like a bit.</p>
<p>Sneak out.</p>
<p>I'm trying to avoid combat.</p>
<p>Leave no witnesses that's what I say.</p>
<p>I wasn't next one.</p>
<p>Emergency we better do that last.</p>
<p>Alright it's very far away you know what i've been in a zoomer for a while.</p>
<p>I'm going to go on ft.</p>
<p>Until I get bored.</p>
<p>I mean it's not like.</p>
<p>Willy wobbly bitch.</p>
<p>Will we will be bitch.</p>
<p>Use the word there's no delis in words just like one quest.</p>
<p>And then do a bunch of shit.</p>
<p>Oh you know I forgot the inner zoomer several islands this might not be on our island but i've got farina.</p>
<p>I'm keeping seeds running that one.</p>
<p>By the way.</p>
<p>Sea dreams now my.</p>
<p>My man healer.</p>
<p>Like a time limit on it I wonder if you can keep it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise it might be an issue.</p>
<p>A potato.</p>
<p>Inazuma canada kind of annoying me that you never clear these shields and stuff completely even when you.</p>
<p>The real question is.</p>
<p>So with things like this tree this tree was electric wasn't it and we had to do quests on electrify it and it was a similar thing with like the mine you're to blow the minds up with a canon.</p>
<p>There's a lot of environmental stuff in this game.</p>
<p>The changes through story.</p>
<p>Story.</p>
<p>Do they just set all the environmental stuff to its.</p>
<p>Turn on stairs.</p>
<p>Why do you still have to do all of the quests associated with those environmental changes.</p>
<p>She fell off.</p>
<p>I can't say anything.</p>
<p>Is there also on another island.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I don't know how to use these.</p>
<p>What did you jump through them.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>However I want I never like riding shotgun.</p>
<p>Turn on a different accountant I just never really like to play another match.</p>
<p>4 berries.</p>
<p>She's very limited she's very specific for specific things.</p>
<p>So if I don't like the character and I don't like the characters kit and.</p>
<p>Saving a redeeming quality.</p>
<p>Follow the sound of converse position is that the.</p>
<p>I've got a distance to target.</p>
<p>Is that those little badger things.</p>
<p>Raccoon whatever supposed to be.</p>
<p>How to get up.</p>
<p>This is very annoying god we had to do this before we had carrara as well.</p>
<p>Miserable.</p>
<p>Up the tree maybe south africa.</p>
<p>There was a cat.</p>
<p>And get rewards or something but I think.</p>
<p>Set number of times you can do it and I think I did it.</p>
<p>All active no active quests i'm guessing sore.</p>
<p>How is confusing me when there's no battle pass for doing commissions with us because I actually emptied the battle pass.</p>
<p>What's the first time in.</p>
<p>Long time.</p>
<p>4,659 primo gems.</p>
<p>Were 20 penny.</p>
<p>I've got four pools in the bag.</p>
<p>20 for the anniversary.</p>
<p>5 for the streaming event.</p>
<p>Two let's say from compensation.</p>
<p>Maybe two for picking kitchen again as my 35 star.</p>
<p>We should be about at a 50/50.</p>
<p>About we might be a bit show.</p>
<p>I find emily so boring.</p>
<p>We did spiral the best.</p>
<p>Which imaginary theatre.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>6 rewards.</p>
<p>Can you vale upper whatever whatever.</p>
<p>Where the fuck is this.</p>
<p>Is australia this aware.</p>
<p>Apparently.</p>
<p>Ok we've got a moral pile.</p>
<p>Here as well.</p>
<p>Down.</p>
<p>Down down down geronimo.</p>
<p>So I see.</p>
<p>Ok well that one might go on here.</p>
<p>I don't know what i'm supposed to do.</p>
<p>It snaps into place normally if you get it rise.</p>
<p>Hey adaptors that arch looks kind of crooked.</p>
<p>Would you look at the seat as a total mess how could one go to class like this.</p>
<p>Ark looks kind of crooked.</p>
<p>I don't know what do you want from me.</p>
<p>He only snaps into place that so he's correct and he's correct the reason I know is because they snap into place.</p>
<p>When you have them correct but this arc doesn't snap into place on either of these green things which is why i'm used to put them.</p>
<p>A third socket that it can go out now.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>I'm pretty good.</p>
<p>I don't see another socket that's the problem.</p>
<p>So I put it there and he said it looks kind of crooked.</p>
<p>But I got it from there.</p>
<p>But it doesn't snap into place on either of them.</p>
<p>So I feel like it's not right.</p>
<p>Why don't see any other socket that can go in now.</p>
<p>Show am I a bit lost.</p>
<p>Unless i'm supposed to.</p>
<p>Would you take a look at this though the chair is something how can a stone start to get blown away.</p>
<p>Why are you best.</p>
<p>Us all I do want to try and.</p>
<p>This is the only area of not 100% it's 500% of everything else.</p>
<p>But I still have changi changi village.</p>
<p>I'd like to get that to 100% I think.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm definitely going for sharky girl I think she's really cool.</p>
<p>And we get karina is it karina we get karina for free anywhere but I think we have to complete the story first so kiss i'm pulling for what she called milani milano.</p>
<p>Time now.</p>
<p>Shark girl.</p>
<p>I think I think I want to pick a picking up a few copies of her anywhere.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm really excited for everybody looks really good all the characters look good.</p>
<p>The regent looks amazing I know it'll be great and then the new changes that were announced is just correct I mean it's about time right on some of it but.</p>
<p>I mean that's two characters that are going to be really fun so carrara is one of my favourite characters.</p>
<p>I'm really glad to see the game moving more in that direction you know i'm off for more trying new things more sort of quality of life I love it it's perfect.</p>
<p>So yeah i'm so so hyped.</p>
<p>Do you.</p>
<p>How is she.</p>
<p>Cuz I built her I didn't really build her at first because you know I just wanted it for exploration really but then I tried building and I couldn't quite get a good build on a but then recently in order to get her particle effects you know her little glory things I had to do so much damage within a small amount of time so I built around em to do it.</p>
<p>Actually surprisingly good.</p>
<p>Yeah since the day she came out I haven't had her off my team since the day she came out like I can't run a team without her she's just she's essential now.</p>
<p>Man is jean interesting.</p>
<p>So are you going for another gene.</p>
<p>When when we pick our free character.</p>
<p>Are you going to pick someone else.</p>
<p>Does kitchens probably my favourite standard character and a user in the spiral abyss.</p>
<p>Constellation for myself.</p>
<p>I was tempted to get tonari cos I don't have him yet but I probably wouldn't play him anywhere because I don't like playing the boys.</p>
<p>Can you play the girls.</p>
<p>Apologise I apologise for my eyes jokes.</p>
<p>What's the join the conversation clearly ok.</p>
<p>I need to figure this out.</p>
<p>That's a good idea actually yeah that's a good idea.</p>
<p>Let me see what is make a chain.</p>
<p>How is c5.</p>
<p>You know a lot more utility with with hyperboom.</p>
<p>Yeah I know i've been trying to get I don't even know how much resin i've spent so I got I got this weapon for my nadia because I think it I think it's amazing on her but the problem is she doesn't have enough crip damage right to bounce the crit rate so if you look at it right now just got like 58.6 crit rate which is great maybe a little too much so I would be happy to sacrifice a little bit of that.</p>
<p>Put damage and a quick damages it's good don't get me wrong but it could be better and so i've been trying to get her.</p>
<p>Circuit.</p>
<p>And i'm not getting you the amount I found this.</p>
<p>I just I never get.</p>
<p>But this set.</p>
<p>I think marrakesh hunter.</p>
<p>Second finally get my navier finished because she's a bit.</p>
<p>What is the what does catching c5 do.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>Ok so we all stellar restoration up by three.</p>
<p>If farming an animal damaged goblet.</p>
<p>But I absolutely despise the.</p>
<p>Play systems and I feel like I don't even mind that it's rng I just think they put the rates too low on the good stuff and so they expect you to just you know.</p>
<p>Have.</p>
<p>Keep trying for where too long.</p>
<p>Would make such a difference.</p>
<p>So yeah i'm with you i'm hyped for that too but.</p>
<p>Is still a band-aid on on an open wound.</p>
<p>The main problem is the rates you know.</p>
<p>Teapots relate to this chest is the.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it's a separate puzzle.</p>
<p>Yeah I cannot figure this out.</p>
<p>So here's what I know right.</p>
<p>If you put one of these.</p>
<p>If you put one of these items somewhere and it doesn't move it's in the wrong spot i'm pretty sure cos when you put it in the right spot it snaps into place.</p>
<p>So I feel like that's the right spot for him.</p>
<p>And same goes for him right as if we're funny enough I think he'll also sit here if I put him here he snaps into place.</p>
<p>So what if I put him back here.</p>
<p>So then it seems to me like well the missing piece must be this arc right so I keep putting here but.</p>
<p>Also says something about all this this arc looks wonky.</p>
<p>So i'm like well.</p>
<p>So what the hell do I do then.</p>
<p>Ark looks kind of crooked.</p>
<p>What do you want me to do about it.</p>
<p>Something.</p>
<p>Somewhere else that needs to go.</p>
<p>I got to be missing something.</p>
<p>Are you talking about a statue getting blown away.</p>
<p>I really don't get this.</p>
<p>What is this something up there.</p>
<p>That seems to actually connect to this one.</p>
<p>Connects to a.</p>
<p>So if this isn't the right place.</p>
<p>He doesn't go he doesn't go here.</p>
<p>I still want to go back to attend class.</p>
<p>Play one of these seats.</p>
<p>So the only thing i'm missing there's got to be something else that goes there let's keep looking around I must be missing something.</p>
<p>It's tidy up on top of one of these hills.</p>
<p>Anything I can think of is what if I still have a class to teach don't touch me so he's like.</p>
<p>I'm missing like one piece.</p>
<p>You're not stephanie the thing that connects to that.</p>
<p>At the same time though that doesn't really snap into place does it I think it just so happened to be.</p>
<p>Connected.</p>
<p>To the top of the other one.</p>
<p>I don't think it's necessarily snapping to connect.</p>
<p>It's that I want thank you.</p>
<p>Ok I don't know the only thing the only thing that makes sense to me is to have a.</p>
<p>It looks good.</p>
<p>I don't know what the heck is going on about.</p>
<p>I was facing the wrong way I must have put that in every other way.</p>
<p>I guess I was just putting it backwards right whatever.</p>
<p>Ok I saw some hillary charles over here the cruising for a bruisin' sam gliding for a.</p>
<p>Beating.</p>
<p>It's very quiet let me turn it up.</p>
<p>Cedron you're actually invincible.</p>
<p>Do you know that.</p>
<p>I built you too well.</p>
<p>What's my screen get rid of that.</p>
<p>I freaking love see you when she's so good.</p>
<p>She's so so good.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm glad though cos I was kind of getting a bit sick of cork on me.</p>
<p>Best healer you could possibly ask for.</p>
<p>Buy now.</p>
<p>And then seasons come along and just really.</p>
<p>You know freshen things up about.</p>
<p>She's super fun.</p>
<p>Why are you so strong.</p>
<p>I don't know what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Camera.</p>
<p>I did not like cockney when she came out.</p>
<p>Willy wally bitch.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Dumpty dumpty that's all you need in life is you jumpy dumpty and you wiggly wobbly.</p>
<p>I need parkway started.</p>
<p>Ok let's be picked this guy up resonate.</p>
<p>Oh yes I see I see.</p>
<p>Very nice.</p>
<p>Ok what are we doing.</p>
<p>Killing hela charles.</p>
<p>It's never a bad day.</p>
<p>It's weird whenever I see a helicopter dead body in the scam I always feel really sad for.</p>
<p>We get to murder them we don't have to deal with the consequences they just vanish.</p>
<p>Shiny treasures so like it's perfect.</p>
<p>Is wayne real life if you kill somebody they don't leave behind shiny treasures.</p>
<p>Chaos.</p>
<p>That would be complete chaos.</p>
<p>Ok stop what do you want to live in a classroom.</p>
<p>Like a moth to a flame.</p>
<p>Make a siege win to a helicopter.</p>
<p>So weird sounds like she's.</p>
<p>What's my name.</p>
<p>It's clean the place right up.</p>
<p>Chileans of the hilly variety.</p>
<p>I know it's the one I was flying on.</p>
<p>Maybe they scattered when they heard the.</p>
<p>Canada.</p>
<p>Caravan calling the police.</p>
<p>On my murderous magazine.</p>
<p>Just a whole lot of waffles.</p>
<p>Is all they serve.</p>
<p>Did not detect anything.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>You tell me you got not.</p>
<p>Terraria.</p>
<p>Do you job.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Why are best car.</p>
<p>Can a nice enough.</p>
<p>I'm not saying yeah that i'm just saying she looks nice.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>Is there nothing.</p>
<p>I don't believe you.</p>
<p>I don't believe it.</p>
<p>I can't hear the chests.</p>
<p>I can't leave with sweet fa.</p>
<p>I see one.</p>
<p>Banned they have around them.</p>
<p>Scandalous absolutely scandalous where to treat visitors.</p>
<p>Treasure.</p>
<p>That was my twin.</p>
<p>Identical.</p>
<p>Identical in appearance but opposite in their sure I would never.</p>
<p>We found something.</p>
<p>Smell.</p>
<p>Disappointment.</p>
<p>Show me where to go it was over this way I was now.</p>
<p>Where's the treasure.</p>
<p>Thank you thank you very much.</p>
<p>Reveal to me your.</p>
<p>Valuables.</p>
<p>How do I go up.</p>
<p>Are you got no stairs what the hell what is with this place.</p>
<p>You stairs go up to here.</p>
<p>And then i'm supposed to climb on the roof.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>You want to fire archit.</p>
<p>Alana.</p>
<p>Does she look like she's carrying a ladder.</p>
<p>I mean do you know how much space does 3000 mins that i'm carrying takes up.</p>
<p>And the other manner of.</p>
<p>Collectibles.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Where is this chest.</p>
<p>You fools.</p>
<p>Why are you trying to hide it for me.</p>
<p>What you said it was.</p>
<p>You literally said it was out here and now you send it over there.</p>
<p>So I climbed on the roof for nothing.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Tea house waitress.</p>
<p>How's the pair.</p>
<p>Team merchants god it's all about tea around here now.</p>
<p>Obsessed.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what stories of tea.</p>
<p>A sergeant with shields.</p>
<p>Weather arms people climb up completely just got their own safety a splash of water resounded in the mountains that was someone putting the kettle on.</p>
<p>Piece of jade emerge from the cloud search forward to the waves and over took them.</p>
<p>Composition on the waves.</p>
<p>Is he foreshadowing.</p>
<p>Spank your ass.</p>
<p>Where is this chest.</p>
<p>What the frick.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Is it open the tree.</p>
<p>The leeway it is.</p>
<p>But the day I thought my my days of treasure hunting in the trees was was behind me.</p>
<p>It is what the.</p>
<p>How.</p>
<p>Should I get sore distracted I was like.</p>
<p>Add right look for the icon in future idiot.</p>
<p>And save yourself like 6 hours.</p>
<p>When genshin was on was printed on toilet paper.</p>
<p>Because we didn't have phones or computers then.</p>
<p>And we didn't have icons from the treasure compass it only showed you the big circle on the map.</p>
<p>Am I missed remembering i'm sure it did I don't remember icons i'm sure it didn't feel like on this before.</p>
<p>Originally I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Have you missed remembering.</p>
<p>You got me climbing all over your.</p>
<p>With promises.</p>
<p>It's got to be obvious somewhere.</p>
<p>Where is it.</p>
<p>It is a different chest but it does lie.</p>
<p>It also lies I think.</p>
<p>Ok it's down it's down it's at this height it's at this height it's.</p>
<p>Are you aware it's this aware.</p>
<p>So how.</p>
<p>Is my progress now 88%.</p>
<p>Are we still missing so much.</p>
<p>Do I walk around my eyes closed i'm as well.</p>
<p>I may as bloody well.</p>
<p>Also I thought I was in upper.</p>
<p>I thought I was working on the.</p>
<p>Intended to be.</p>
<p>I don't want to be westest.</p>
<p>I'm not against the west.</p>
<p>Are the east flat manor I mean they just.</p>
<p>This is directions from a specific.</p>
<p>Perspective you know.</p>
<p>Literally all they are why would I why would I have a preference of one of the other.</p>
<p>All right let's pop the compass.</p>
<p>South east.</p>
<p>Southwest shut up.</p>
<p>I was just testing you make sure you knew.</p>
<p>I don't know what your kids do all day on tiktok probably not learning about geography.</p>
<p>But if I wanted to learn about geography on youtube I bet I could find a youtube video about it.</p>
<p>Can you find one on tiktok.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>We should have a we should have a tick tock off I should have a tick tock off with the kids.</p>
<p>Play mean is like you know I should like challenge the kids and be like hey.</p>
<p>You do this this is the challenge we do this and then I go try and do it.</p>
<p>The kids try and do on tik tok and we see you like who's better who's wins it will get to get it first.</p>
<p>Sounded weird.</p>
<p>So there's a socket ear.</p>
<p>On some kind of.</p>
<p>Statue like device would be my guess cuz then only statue like devices or one of those little owls about one of those little owl sits there.</p>
<p>So we need to find albert.</p>
<p>Is the in star real.</p>
<p>Anybody got his tiktok.</p>
<p>Press.</p>
<p>He would have won if you had a channel don't look at me like that.</p>
<p>I'm happy with it I know what i'm talking about.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>What's your tiktok address.</p>
<p>Baby.</p>
<p>Do I still have the owl.</p>
<p>I picked up an owl.</p>
<p>It's a jumpy owl.</p>
<p>I saw a blob it's a blob.</p>
<p>I see another owl but it's jumpy owl.</p>
<p>I just I just don't understand.</p>
<p>Don't understand.</p>
<p>I remember when things made sense things were made of clay in wood.</p>
<p>We used our hands.</p>
<p>Not these screens.</p>
<p>We are great.</p>
<p>Injured.</p>
<p>See I know what i'm talking about.</p>
<p>You should drop in I am.</p>
<p>What are you even doing.</p>
<p>Call that sits in this last.</p>
<p>Is this far away.</p>
<p>Since we've already got the icon for that one.</p>
<p>And since we still need to find the owl.</p>
<p>Jesus season give me one and next time you got to drop out the sky.</p>
<p>Good god.</p>
<p>Is it good job you got 66593 hp in it.</p>
<p>Ok where was the chest I thought I was going towards the chest and then I i literally had kittens.</p>
<p>Will my melody hit.</p>
<p>Ok I remember seeing the wind we cannot see things from high up right.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>I lost it I somehow lost it I had it in my sights I remember flying over these guys here.</p>
<p>To get away.</p>
<p>I see it ok let's go for a smooth landing this time ok.</p>
<p>Smooth landing.</p>
<p>I want something for that danny would you want.</p>
<p>I can't believe you too haven't left yet it's dangerous here it's best not to tell you here too long.</p>
<p>Terry.</p>
<p>What the hell does that mean.</p>
<p>Switch things are far too dangerous.</p>
<p>Shut up you idiot.</p>
<p>You're a bubble.</p>
<p>I'm a bubble on me.</p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>Well that was all for not.</p>
<p>And i've got no stamina.</p>
<p>I'm impatient.</p>
<p>So there's the chest.</p>
<p>Did the socket.</p>
<p>It looks like it wants an owl.</p>
<p>So where the hell is it.</p>
<p>Here are the olly olly olly olly olly olly.</p>
<p>Quiet night honey.</p>
<p>Is that a real owl or is it as a statue of an owl swims on the mark.</p>
<p>Yes true.</p>
<p>So should be around.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>You don't speak you don't speak either.</p>
<p>Are still your tea will you speak to me then.</p>
<p>I know how much you love your precious tea.</p>
<p>Try putting the kettle on where you got no tea leaves left.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I give up.</p>
<p>I genuinely don't know where this hour is.</p>
<p>I've looked.</p>
<p>Almost everywhere.</p>
<p>I already have.</p>
<p>Guard for hire.</p>
<p>Met you.</p>
<p>Australia lose weight maybe another guard for hire why would you wear bright red if you were guard for hire like if I wanted you for a job man.</p>
<p>Cancel the god.</p>
<p>It's all guards for hire drinking tea.</p>
<p>Is this place.</p>
<p>All I want it was an owl statue.</p>
<p>I wasn't asking much.</p>
<p>I finally a team merchant.</p>
<p>How can you possibly have that much to say about tea.</p>
<p>I mean I love the stuff myself but.</p>
<p>Who's this.</p>
<p>Hydrologist.</p>
<p>What makes sense that you be where the kettle's are I guess.</p>
<p>I am losing my patience now.</p>
<p>That will help right there's one of those.</p>
<p>As one of these.</p>
<p>So how is our exploration looking now farina.</p>
<p>I want you stand here and show me.</p>
<p>89% it doesn't move.</p>
<p>It was 89% before.</p>
<p>Points of interest or whatever the hell I called.</p>
<p>2 days and 10 hours less than a year.</p>
<p>How long now.</p>
<p>Play the channels are on crack again.</p>
<p>Have you got one of those things where they keep spawning.</p>
<p>Are you been learning how to ask questions of peak or something.</p>
<p>It's like a pico question.</p>
<p>What's the most exciting pass.</p>
<p>I don't know jesus.</p>
<p>It's all good combats good explorations amazing I love exploration.</p>
<p>I have a fulfilling enjoyable time with exploration I don't necessarily find it exciting.</p>
<p>More so than I would exploration.</p>
<p>But if you took combat out of this game I would probably still play but I will admit it would lose a lot if you took it out.</p>
<p>Now would I still play this game if they took exploration out that would that would be a big hit that would be a big big hit of the game.</p>
<p>For me you know if they said ok no my world's congratulations let's say they said ok congratulations you found that one that's the end of the story you really have a night with your brother and from now on everything's gonna be instant space within that land.</p>
<p>Awful.</p>
<p>And the level design is absolutely spectacular and it's just it's such a gorgeous game to be in and just to explore.</p>
<p>And you just relied on the combat and the skinner box stuff.</p>
<p>Unskippable cutscene stories here and there.</p>
<p>So really you asked me the wrong question boo because exciting isn't always what makes a good game.</p>
<p>Engaging maybe.</p>
<p>When I first.</p>
<p>So there are some smaller areas in genshin like instant spurs things like if you go into those mirrors.</p>
<p>Fontan.</p>
<p>And then you go into one of those little mini instance world things you know I don't get excited to explore like it's just too small but I do still get like you know you know I wonder what's around here there's still like a kind of.</p>
<p>Curiosity.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Willingness to engage you know I want to engage but like walking in the inazuma.</p>
<p>Unlike.</p>
<p>Samaria for the first time or whatever yeah definitely much more so like.</p>
<p>Knowing that you have a much bigger area of expires going to be a shit turn in it.</p>
<p>How.</p>
<p>What are we on 3 hours.</p>
<p>I don't know why this frame rate suddenly started thanking but it did.</p>
<p>From my perspective it's.</p>
<p>What's definitely struggling a bit more.</p>
<p>Play the game.</p>
<p>Can I have a unity open in the background.</p>
<p>Anything still like.</p>
<p>Consistently smooth most of the time.</p>
<p>Is cannot find the owl i'm guessing it's an owl statue that it wants but I just can't seem to find it anywhere.</p>
<p>It's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>I'll put my ass.</p>
<p>I park my ass in monster because.</p>
<p>Otherwise I was going to say I will stand here.</p>
<p>6 so many times the will stand here in this very safe place where there are no enemies for getting that I already cleared the area of enemies must login the next day and it's like.</p>
<p>I'm sleepy time.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Can I hit me.</p>
<p>Hip hop daily point you know.</p>
<p>So I will leave it here for today.</p>
<p>I think pc boo is looking fixed.</p>
<p>Are you leaving twitch I don't know somebody must have I don't remember being asked that.</p>
<p>Somebody asked.</p>
<p>When was it.</p>
<p>Not sure when that was.</p>
<p>I don't remember reading that.</p>
<p>Is it going to read this.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't remember I don't remember reading are you live in twitch.</p>
<p>If I have unless I just missed it I have no idea.</p>
<p>I don't know but you know whenever I test it it seems fine.</p>
<p>I don't think youtube chat has ever been perfect.</p>
<p>How was missed the odd one I think.</p>
<p>On youtube is weird right because sometimes i'll see something in chat that got modded out.</p>
<p>Like it's like the auto mod removed it.</p>
<p>Especially links right if somebody posts a link in youtube.</p>
<p>Who will read the link out.</p>
<p>But the youtube chat.</p>
<p>On the side here it'll be like it'll have been automated removed out and there's no options for that either there's no way to like.</p>
<p>Like change that.</p>
<p>Pcb obviously picked up the message and read it out but youtube like automatically removed it or something from the chat.</p>
<p>So sometimes I think that happens as well.</p>
<p>On youtube.</p>
<p>We have for the most part it seems like booze fixed I finished my match 3 game.</p>
<p>Finished.</p>
<p>And yeah I think we.</p>
<p>So on that note I will leave it here and be back on tomorrow.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
