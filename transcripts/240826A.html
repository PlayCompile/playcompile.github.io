<h3>From Live stream on Monday 26-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYGsRjzM0TU​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYGsRjzM0TU​</a></h3>
<p>Bright face.</p>
<p>Turning like hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>Brad face.</p>
<p>Why does my ass hurt so much.</p>
<p>It doesn't I just thought it would be a funny song just want to go on record and set doesn't actually it's fine it's absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Ok we have a list of things we want to do.</p>
<p>Cancel.</p>
<p>Ok so on our list of things to fix.</p>
<p>We have fixed time on broken neck is first on the agenda what does that mean why did I break payments neck well I didn't mean to.</p>
<p>Basically over a set amount of time so i'll explain what causes it.</p>
<p>So I have a script on some of my 3d models in uni.</p>
<p>Randomly raw hits body parts within a range that we set just to make it look alive right to add some movement to it without like having specific animations just to add some variation.</p>
<p>We first used it on.</p>
<p>Catchy pete.</p>
<p>Version 2.</p>
<p>Can we carry it over to pc boo why aren't you loading uni what is your problem.</p>
<p>It's uni is not what is going on.</p>
<p>Load the damn thing.</p>
<p>Power off to a great start today.</p>
<p>What the fuck is happening.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>Yep it's there.</p>
<p>It is their unity.</p>
<p>I've never seen it do this before.</p>
<p>Let me just.</p>
<p>Close it completely.</p>
<p>And reopen it.</p>
<p>Should we just.</p>
<p>What's the new version 6 has all kinds of errors.</p>
<p>But to be fair we.</p>
<p>Define with pc boo for now.</p>
<p>So i'm tempted ok here's what we'll do.</p>
<p>I'm happy with pc boo for now so what we're going to do is we're going to make a new backup copy.</p>
<p>Have it right now.</p>
<p>You can't see my thing I need to get used to doing stuff on the right side of screen so you can see what i'm doing.</p>
<p>So let's just back this up before we upgrade it and kiss anything goes wrong.</p>
<p>Version 6 just use the latest.</p>
<p>Which I think is this one right cuz 14 is higher than 5 so you would think.</p>
<p>Hello now it would be a great time to find out if there is even newer versions.</p>
<p>614 f1.</p>
<p>Unable.</p>
<p>Unable to load editor versions please check your internet connection.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>What is why what.</p>
<p>God help me yes there's.</p>
<p>Ok there's a 16.</p>
<p>Which is that even higher than 14 selects go and get that and will upgrade all our unity 6s.</p>
<p>Two version 16 of unisex.</p>
<p>Anything brakes then we revert back.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong you think I would have learnt my lesson with you.</p>
<p>Well I would hope that it.</p>
<p>Better with time like me.</p>
<p>How many teeth do we have.</p>
<p>How many teeth we have.</p>
<p>R&g.</p>
<p>Kids have 20 so you get extra teeth when you get older kids start with 20 and then you level up and you get an extra yeah that makes sense.</p>
<p>I can understand why.</p>
<p>Slots gum slots.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah I got 29 left right i'm fine.</p>
<p>I got 29 left.</p>
<p>I can still eat.</p>
<p>Not looking forward to the day when I have to go everything down there.</p>
<p>Like a turtle.</p>
<p>Do turtles have teeth.</p>
<p>It looks like it's gummy stuff down do taught us have teeth.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That's me.</p>
<p>5 years from now probably i'm not too far off he's got yeah cos he never leaves the house right he's got no teeth it's old as fuck.</p>
<p>It's me i'm a turtle.</p>
<p>Yeah they do.</p>
<p>What do tardis.</p>
<p>Eat grasses leaves flowers succulents that's cacti in it.</p>
<p>Vegetables then cos I i dodge vegetables fruits are dodge most of those as well commercial tart is foods what the hell are commercial tartus foods is that like mcdonald's for tardis is.</p>
<p>Guitarist.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>No thanks.</p>
<p>Ok so we're getting unity version 6.16.</p>
<p>In progress.</p>
<p>Hopefully they've addressed some of these bugs I mean I don't.</p>
<p>Can you give us more information more information I live stream the thing I vote the thing I sent you the project I give you a detailed description of what's happening.</p>
<p>Still at least i'm not an unreal engine user.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is fast to leave unity.</p>
<p>I do really like you.</p>
<p>When it works.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know it's.</p>
<p>Oh did you did you know by the way I don't know I don't know how much you sore from yesterday so you can now play hungry hungry prime on if you got to play compile.</p>
<p>Let's play games hungry hungry poem on.</p>
<p>And you can even zoom in check it out if you zoom in.</p>
<p>Even I even i'm surprised by how good it looks on the website though like it's like holy shit when you zoom in.</p>
<p>Yeah when you zoom in like look at how clear it looks it's so it looks so good.</p>
<p>I'm actually kind of gobsmack by how good that looks.</p>
<p>Double points for burgers.</p>
<p>Most of them are raw image components so they're like kind of like sprites but a bit fancier.</p>
<p>But yeah there's no camera in this.</p>
<p>Yeah I think the craving system was a really good idea.</p>
<p>Yes wants more pizza.</p>
<p>Pizza we can give you pizza.</p>
<p>Yet my highest score was about to did I hit did I break 200 I think I got to boot 330 in my highest run.</p>
<p>It's the weird thing about that project is it was such a bitch to make.</p>
<p>And it only felt good at the.</p>
<p>Like everything had to be like everything had to be lined up for it to start to feel like it was worth it because I think for me the most amazing part is in those games is like as the foods dropping and you're getting extra matches and it's just all like happening in real time and you watching it and it's just.</p>
<p>Sing for me that's like that's the magic when it's like oh wow it's just like super cool.</p>
<p>And of course that's like.</p>
<p>That was weird because it took so long to really feel like I don't know the gameplay was actually engaging in anywhere.</p>
<p>Not easy to make.</p>
<p>Ok so let's try upgrading to the latest version of uni which is 16 and see if everything looks good we backed it up.</p>
<p>Add boot no no boo.</p>
<p>Call boo that is the last thing you should do if you want things to run.</p>
<p>I do this because i'm a maniac and I like.</p>
<p>Ok i'm sat on a giant spike right now.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend this.</p>
<p>Peter said something but boo ignored him.</p>
<p>Genshin version 5.0 prenatal is now available.</p>
<p>But I got ill stuff to do tonight so i'll join your stream again.</p>
<p>Cancel the alarm.</p>
<p>It's like a love letter isn't it it's like a love letter from a long distance ex lover or something so i'll join your stream again later tonight like a message in a bottle i'll watch you in a future stream by ok my love take care.</p>
<p>Is youtube working then I want is it broken again.</p>
<p>Test textbook takes a little while.</p>
<p>So you're not having a good monday fightful.</p>
<p>Mondays are always rough anyway normally.</p>
<p>Some of the project source files refers to an old api do you want to update yes.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Yes it looks like youtube chats broken again.</p>
<p>I give up.</p>
<p>Will take a look at we're going to look at it anyway.</p>
<p>Link download games on website.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was thinking I can probably just link the zip file directly I would think.</p>
<p>The zip file is there so if I copy that link was that look like.</p>
<p>One what's one day 16 hours.</p>
<p>Technically it's wednesday but like.</p>
<p>Spiritually.</p>
<p>It's kind of like tuesday night for me I don't know if I probably will still actually.</p>
<p>It's not everyday you get a new genshin region.</p>
<p>What was that link looking like.</p>
<p>Github.</p>
<p>So there's the hungry hungry time on link.</p>
<p>And then we want finch ball.</p>
<p>French ball.</p>
<p>Release finger zip copy link.</p>
<p>Right we got.</p>
<p>Lots of arrows.</p>
<p>Medium pipeline asset pass a failure line 90 expected closing curly brackets.</p>
<p>Ok that's weird.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>And also visual studio didn't pick up this happens.</p>
<p>Do you know what sometimes fix is it just literally just save the project closet and reopen.</p>
<p>I don't know unity sometimes has issues when it does the up.</p>
<p>And it loads the project.</p>
<p>Play sometimes it like gets confused loading the project as it's upgraded if that makes sense so if you exit and then load it after the upgrade.</p>
<p>A lot of these things.</p>
<p>Look really scary.</p>
<p>Actually just.</p>
<p>Evening really exist.</p>
<p>Load the project something obviously isn't getting.</p>
<p>Ok everything working perfectly so far so he detected without we've already run ads and he hasn't run out how to add everything's connected fine no arrows subscribe to twitch events.</p>
<p>Youtube chat.</p>
<p>I think now takes a couple of minutes I think we wait a couple of minutes for it to warm up before we connect i'm not sure I can't remember.</p>
<p>Send send a text to in youtube.</p>
<p>Where is your job.</p>
<p>What's the canvas.</p>
<p>I really need to do something about I need to organise chat better because it's like at the moment it's scattered around the freaking project and it always takes me forever to find everything.</p>
<p>So I want to bring it all together.</p>
<p>Yeah so we're not getting.</p>
<p>Youtube chat api.</p>
<p>What's currently disabled so let's see if that switches itself on.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't then that explains why it's not working I know there we go right it just came on now ok yeah so we can test it now so and maybe it was just too early when pig is sent his message that could be it but I also sent a message so let's do a test 3.</p>
<p>It's working fine.</p>
<p>Ok it's running ads I don't know why it shouldn't have run ads.</p>
<p>Because it should have updated the tag on twitch to say i've already run ads.</p>
<p>So yeah it shouldn't.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Localhost.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>Project files.</p>
<p>So I can link specifically to the rebars here I think.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So let's look at project files.</p>
<p>His project files.</p>
<p>And hungry.</p>
<p>Stop.</p>
<p>Caps lock.</p>
<p>Match 3 mini game.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I took a double quote out by mistake.</p>
<p>Add the equals.</p>
<p>And then hungry hungry time on.</p>
<p>Report.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Menu card from github.</p>
<p>And I copied it.</p>
<p>But like just a joy to use well you know.</p>
<p>On website.</p>
<p>Record to reverse engineer the menu for my for mine.</p>
<p>Which is why which is why it says things like sponsors exploring topics.</p>
<p>These are leftover from when it was the get hook menu.</p>
<p>Tutorials links so for this one what i'm going to need to do it's kind of weird right because the match 3 mini game has been such a sporadic project.</p>
<p>So my plan is to make a youtube playlist of the live streams I assume you can make live stream playlist I don't know actually but find out.</p>
<p>Make a playlist of the live stream vods that have the tutorial so for finch bother was part 1 and part 2 so I can basically make a playlist with those two videos on it and then linked to that playlist for the tutorials link.</p>
<p>The problem with hungry hungry time on is.</p>
<p>I didn't do them well I didn't have the idea to make these tutorial streams when I first started working on it I was just you know doing what I do and messing about and that was quite a while ago as well and even I don't know when I don't think anybody could follow that as a tutorial honestly even even I couldn't do it it's just too all over the place and two manic and too crazy.</p>
<p>So I don't think I can link.</p>
<p>How much 3 is a tutorial specifically.</p>
<p>But I want to link the.</p>
<p>I want to link the.</p>
<p>Ok so how the hell do we make a playlist let's see playlists.</p>
<p>Where did the playlists.</p>
<p>Will interestingly enough ok.</p>
<p>Does a unity tutorial nobody in their right mind would watch a playlist of random unity tutorials.</p>
<p>That would unless you are the most insane person who ever lived imagine that oh yes I want I want I want to I want to follow random unity tutorials in a random order no one in the world's ever going to want to do that.</p>
<p>So that if you want to I don't know see me doing xylophone zero you can just get it from my playlist.</p>
<p>Set it's like i'm almost can I use them as tags in a way.</p>
<p>I'm just thinking do I just rename unity tutorial to finch ball unity tutorial.</p>
<p>And I make a different playlist for the next one.</p>
<p>What do I want to do I want a unity tutorial playlist that just has them all in I guess it could be good if you're looking for a specific tutorial and you just want to filter all the tutorials.</p>
<p>I do that sometimes if i'm looking for something on someone's channel sometimes i'll be like ok i'm looking for whatever it is this video that I know I watched and it was for this and if they've set up playlists like this it just lets you fill up some of the content better.</p>
<p>I think so because.</p>
<p>It's good for filtering isn't it if you're looking for something specifically because the other thing is well like somebody like might be like you know they find my page and they're like they already know that okay so he plays and he can piles so i'm interested in one or the other and if you're interested in the other as soon as you see unity tutorial you probably going to be like oh ok let's you know this is probably the first place you click ok let's let's see what is you know what kind of stuff has he got in here and then this is where you can be like oh yeah ok i'm interested or i'm not or whatever so yeah I think I think i'll keep that I need to make a new playlist and I have no idea how to do it.</p>
<p>Tell me which playlist I want to put it in the button that says create new so i've never actually created a playlist from my homepage before I don't know how the fuck to do it.</p>
<p>Your channel playlist.</p>
<p>Recently added.</p>
<p>How the hell do you make a new playlist.</p>
<p>Create.</p>
<p>Upload video go live creators none of those.</p>
<p>How to create youtube playlist.</p>
<p>I have to navigate to the video I want to add.</p>
<p>Let's go back to this.</p>
<p>That's part 2 I want to start with part 1 really.</p>
<p>View full playlist.</p>
<p>Save to playlist.</p>
<p>Ok create new playlist.</p>
<p>Finch bowl.</p>
<p>Attention.</p>
<p>Mini jam.</p>
<p>Unity.</p>
<p>Tutorial.</p>
<p>Public.</p>
<p>Create.</p>
<p>Save to playlist.</p>
<p>Fish bowl.</p>
<p>Fish bowl genshin mini-game tutorial playlist part 1 part 2 beautiful.</p>
<p>Call kenshin.</p>
<p>Tutorials.</p>
<p>Yeah that should be fine.</p>
<p>Test.</p>
<p>The project files.</p>
<p>Yeah I think they should open in a new link as well let's make those new.</p>
<p>Set a target.</p>
<p>Equals.</p>
<p>It's target equals quote underscore blank in lowercase.</p>
<p>Like that I think.</p>
<p>Project files.</p>
<p>Tutorials genshin minigame.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be bad practice to do that because like and I kind of agree.</p>
<p>Because like the concept is like if you if you force someone to open in a new tab it's like.</p>
<p>You can't stop it from doing that but if you want to open a normal link in a new tab you know you can do it easily I think it's like ctrl or shift or something camera which one but you can do it.</p>
<p>What's the naked decide if they want any news.</p>
<p>And one of the things mentioned was like you know opening links in new tabs is a normal because the user should be allowed to decide if they want that or not.</p>
<p>Anyway whatever.</p>
<p>Everything looks great.</p>
<p>Start to the life size.</p>
<p>But then I do want to see about adding a search function which is going to be tricky on a static site I know there are ways.</p>
<p>I think one of the most common ways is what did we actually update we only updated menu didn't we.</p>
<p>We only updated menu.</p>
<p>So let's ask chachi pt.</p>
<p>Because I also want to I don't know there's two ways about doing this.</p>
<p>So what we could do is we could do a global search.</p>
<p>That just searches the whole website which is probably the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>Or because transcripts.</p>
<p>Is meant to be is meant to horny exists to help you find a.</p>
<p>Stream on a specific topic I could make a search function that's self-contained within transcripts so here's your ability to search transcripts here's your search box and then you know everything else you never get through the menus anywhere.</p>
<p>I don't know the other issue with the global searches I don't really have a lot of room left on my menu because like.</p>
<p>If you're running in.</p>
<p>How far is it about this size yeah what kind of start to run out of room really.</p>
<p>But what I might do is stick a well what I could do actually is short and contact me and make that an at sign.</p>
<p>And then add a magnifying glass neck like a magnifying glass next to it and then the magnifying glasses search.</p>
<p>I also to be fair I also added the word home.</p>
<p>Because it's not necessarily clear the clicking the logo will take you to the homepage.</p>
<p>What I could do is I could move the word home.</p>
<p>And place it here.</p>
<p>Just set downloads.</p>
<p>That says home.</p>
<p>And we can think about adding the word home to the logo.</p>
<p>Again it's like it depends who's your the other thing is as well write it depends who is your website targeted at and I think this is a big thing write like if you're making a website for kids or genshin players I think idiot-proof idiot proofing is always a good idea to be honest.</p>
<p>Idiot proofing.</p>
<p>Is a lot more important for a website aimed at kids are non-tech users during normies are genshin players you know what I mean casual people like sounds a bit insulting but it's true because like you know they they.</p>
<p>What's people don't really know that much about you know these devices and computers and websites and stuff that they use they just they know the bare minimal to any to get buy because this is not interested and that's fair enough so I think making things as simple as possible is always a good thing but.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>Like me me adding the word call me is my brain saying well people might not know that you can click the logo to go to the homepage so let's just add a second home link there as well.</p>
<p>And I kind of like that at first but then if I think the more I think about it like I don't know I would imagine most people if they're ever going to be using my website I probably quite technical people write that because they're more than likely here to do some uni stuff let's be honest.</p>
<p>And so.</p>
<p>Hello how are you thank you.</p>
<p>Do you just like I don't know.</p>
<p>But yeah hope it went well.</p>
<p>Yeah if you're on this website then you more than likely you know.</p>
<p>A programmer.</p>
<p>How old good luck hope it all goes well when do you find out.</p>
<p>Well at least now you can chill right you can start relax.</p>
<p>So when I was in school and I did my school exams my last exam was on my birthday which kind of sucked because I didn't really want to do an exam on my birthday but it was also kind of nice because it was like okay I got that exam out the way it was an early morning exam I think it was about 10:00 or something.</p>
<p>10:11 channel 12 something like that.</p>
<p>Read my last exam and it was my birthday so it was like okay now.</p>
<p>Memories.</p>
<p>You also finished fontaine act 2.</p>
<p>Feel about it fontaine was great.</p>
<p>It is right on.</p>
<p>Upon us.</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p>So I might make some apps at some point.</p>
<p>Ok so let's see what that looks like we're getting rid of the word home.</p>
<p>And yeah downloads instead of.</p>
<p>Game downloads I think is much more.</p>
<p>Play games.</p>
<p>How was your last message if I beat fontaine tomorrow that means I beat.</p>
<p>And fontaine question four days.</p>
<p>You mad one.</p>
<p>Ok yeah I think that's fine so now if I put a search in here.</p>
<p>I don't know where do you think search should be.</p>
<p>Where do where do websites normally put their searches.</p>
<p>On the i'm feeling like it might want to be on the end or near the beginning I don't know.</p>
<p>Search I see i'm tempted to put it.</p>
<p>Call contact me like.</p>
<p>Because then it's like ok here's some content here's some content here's some content he's some content here's some content here.</p>
<p>If you still can't find what you're looking for he is a search and then last but not least if you need to get in touch he is how you contact me.</p>
<p>Contact me to contact.</p>
<p>Ok i'm liking this yeah I think I would put search.</p>
<p>I think I would put search.</p>
<p>After play games let's see what that's going to look like.</p>
<p>How long is that going to be.</p>
<p>A school project.</p>
<p>It's all more tools in your belt right.</p>
<p>It's all good to do.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I'm going to want to put i'm going to need to ask chat gpt how we do this.</p>
<p>But for now i'm just going to I just want to see what it looks like so i'm just going to copy this contact me link.</p>
<p>And i'll just type.</p>
<p>Plastic bottle recycling.</p>
<p>Ok so this would be search.</p>
<p>Yeah I think that could be good.</p>
<p>Ok so let's ask chat gpt.</p>
<p>How we go about doing this so I think what I want is when you hover your mouse over the menu you get these dropdowns right for search I want it so that you hover your mouse over search and a text box.</p>
<p>Add input.</p>
<p>An input box appears where you can.</p>
<p>Yeah that's that's cool.</p>
<p>Cool I have no idea how to do it.</p>
<p>Right so let's ask chachi pt how we go about doing this.</p>
<p>So if we load normal notepad.</p>
<p>So we can construct a.</p>
<p>I am using.</p>
<p>A menu on my website.</p>
<p>And would like a.</p>
<p>Xbox.</p>
<p>In first.</p>
<p>Do appear when.</p>
<p>Over the search.</p>
<p>Link how can I do that.</p>
<p>To make a text box input appear when hovering over the search link you can achieve this using css he is how you can do it.</p>
<p>Your favourite person.</p>
<p>Or maybe a favourite person.</p>
<p>Sounds like you're very busy.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Ok so it said to do this and then on the css we've got some styling here.</p>
<p>So I think we're loading a style sheet.</p>
<p>We're not actually.</p>
<p>Anna lisa fisher who is that.</p>
<p>Not heard of them.</p>
<p>Oh isn't that the voice actress for fire.</p>
<p>Yes yeah recogniser.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah I saw her live stream with the boot hills voice actor whether we're talking about star ireland stuff yeah she does a great job with firefly.</p>
<p>Tv tv.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok so what we could do.</p>
<p>Set the moment what we're doing is we've got our styles for the menu.</p>
<p>In a style container.</p>
<p>And then we have our html.</p>
<p>Meeting this up let me.</p>
<p>First what we can do is.</p>
<p>Separate that and we can make a menu style sheet which is what I think we should do.</p>
<p>And paste it into a new file.</p>
<p>Can we can add the.</p>
<p>Styling the where was that.</p>
<p>Set alarm amazing.</p>
<p>Thank you for dropping bye.</p>
<p>And I will catch you later.</p>
<p>Ok so we've got extra styling here for the search box.</p>
<p>Any downside of doing it this way is.</p>
<p>Styling.</p>
<p>You don't have to be in.</p>
<p>I'm already in ht docs.</p>
<p>I want to save it as a style sheet.</p>
<p>No I don't know why notepad.</p>
<p>Plus plus gives you all these different formats because essentially it's just saving ascii text and this is something you can get very lost in it's at the end of the day the extension is css i'm just used to sticking all types in there so that I can type it in myself so this one is for the menu right so what we're going to do is we're going to call it menu.in.</p>
<p>Just linked it.</p>
<p>So if I load I do that on my normal page is so if we load my index page.</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>I'm pretending i'm teaching when really i'm teaching myself cos I couldn't remember the syntax but they got this is where we load the style sheet on the index page.</p>
<p>So we just need to add.</p>
<p>No it's not ignore me that's ok that is how you link a style sheet but this is for google fonts.</p>
<p>Link rel style sheets equals my style.css.</p>
<p>How did arrow in our.</p>
<p>Oops well it's been working fine so it should be fine.</p>
<p>Can you do.</p>
<p>Probably should length of.</p>
<p>Forward slash the reason.</p>
<p>Group directory and because some of my pages are within subdirectories.</p>
<p>That just makes sure that it pulls the style sheet from the root folder and not from whatever folder we happen to be in.</p>
<p>Now let's dial that because it doesn't look like it belongs to this website it looks like somebody just stuck it on willy-nilly also as I move my mouse away from search.</p>
<p>It's easy it's easy to turn it off.</p>
<p>Actually hard to keep it open.</p>
<p>Yeah you can do it but it's.</p>
<p>Tells more than it succeeds because I guess there's like an area where you're not really.</p>
<p>I'm actually going to i'm actually gonna tell charging bt off for this.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>Don't devastate me then.</p>
<p>Scary woman.</p>
<p>Call gap between the link and a text box it often disappears as I try to hover over the input box.</p>
<p>So it's gonna give me the modified.</p>
<p>Gmail.</p>
<p>And what we can actually do with the css.</p>
<p>Is common an hour as well.</p>
<p>Search box.</p>
<p>Personal in got.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Refresh.</p>
<p>That didn't work at all.</p>
<p>That didn't do shit.</p>
<p>Ok I can probably fix this myself.</p>
<p>Right so the moment it says top 100% so let's just change that to 10% and see what that does.</p>
<p>Play also want to make it bigger as well so now we just got to find out where it needs to be.</p>
<p>So let's try 90%.</p>
<p>Very close.</p>
<p>85%.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Now it's impossible.</p>
<p>To hit like.</p>
<p>To not be hovering over the text box when you go down to search.</p>
<p>Make sure that works at different zoom levels.</p>
<p>Yes ok.</p>
<p>Good good.</p>
<p>Black background and white text so it looks like.</p>
<p>What's the best website.</p>
<p>So let's see.</p>
<p>So i'm going to try giving it yeah also.</p>
<p>It was given to be honest it was given a margin top of five pixels.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>Because that might have.</p>
<p>That might the bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Sometimes you know it's chachi pt is the smartest stupid not a person I know.</p>
<p>Yes i'm sticking with that ok so height let's try.</p>
<p>Some arbitrary number.</p>
<p>6969 is the number we always need to start with.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Has one big meaty.</p>
<p>Send a text box.</p>
<p>What are you.</p>
<p>Who doesn't like a nice.</p>
<p>Shut up rice.</p>
<p>Yeah like that.</p>
<p>That's a nice size.</p>
<p>That's that feels right to me right the font wants to be bigger and out.</p>
<p>Let me see.</p>
<p>Does a search input have a background colour.</p>
<p>So if we look at our.</p>
<p>Make it to make it exactly the same.</p>
<p>Can you which is like a grey colour.</p>
<p>But I think jet black looks a bit.</p>
<p>Tacked on as well you know.</p>
<p>Personally.</p>
<p>I don't know 222 see what that looks like.</p>
<p>Yeah that's about the same colour as the background it looks like it belongs to the site mark just nice our inputs black I think about bit dark it's fine let's try 111.</p>
<p>You know what.</p>
<p>13:13 is the weather yeah I like that a lot.</p>
<p>Type to search.</p>
<p>Larger should be the next thing that we do.</p>
<p>So let's try 15 points.</p>
<p>That's much better.</p>
<p>Like it's a bit now that we've got a nice big meatly box I think it needs to be you know a bit more padding on it.</p>
<p>So I don't know what this padding does so i'm going to change it to 95 I don't know whether that's padding on the inside or on the outside.</p>
<p>There we go that looks great I really like that actually.</p>
<p>Now that's better.</p>
<p>Ok and the next thing I know is.</p>
<p>Our search text.</p>
<p>And our cursor.</p>
<p>I probably both black I think.</p>
<p>See what colour does.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Colour is the way to go are we get both the cursor colosseums to change both the cursor and the input text.</p>
<p>I am searching.</p>
<p>Was a few words we could go right we could put a button beneath it.</p>
<p>Horizontal space.</p>
<p>How can I place a button.</p>
<p>Venice.</p>
<p>Begin.</p>
<p>Search.</p>
<p>You can include the button inside the search rapper container.</p>
<p>What is that song.</p>
<p>Is that right.</p>
<p>Will I never.</p>
<p>Will I bloody never.</p>
<p>You don't say.</p>
<p>Are you going to give me some css for that.</p>
<p>You are but because I don't.</p>
<p>Want your styling cos you're styling sucks.</p>
<p>Search button.</p>
<p>Style.</p>
<p>I don't want to lose my changes and it gave us an extra line to add here as well did not actually let's.</p>
<p>And add.</p>
<p>That as well.</p>
<p>What the hell is that.</p>
<p>What are you doing my beautiful website what is that that's the worst thing i've ever seen.</p>
<p>What are you doing to me.</p>
<p>You stupid fuck.</p>
<p>That place is the button.</p>
<p>Under the link.</p>
<p>Constantly i'd like it to appear with the input box please.</p>
<p>Can we make it less bing.</p>
<p>You know what I wonder if some of the other I wonder some of the other css.</p>
<p>Might have gotten changed surely input box and button on hover.</p>
<p>Search container and input box.</p>
<p>Display block.</p>
<p>Ok so let's replace the button.</p>
<p>And I think it's took out.</p>
<p>You gaslight me you gaslight me.</p>
<p>Piece of shit what is this are you still gaslighting me.</p>
<p>Ok what i'm going to do.</p>
<p>I'm just going to stick this in a separate tab.</p>
<p>Because it might be the some of the other css.</p>
<p>Close updated that I haven't copied because I don't want to lose my styling.</p>
<p>Just to test that.</p>
<p>All of the css that it gave me in this.</p>
<p>To see if that actually.</p>
<p>Does work on.</p>
<p>Ok I made a bunch of changes that you don't know.</p>
<p>Now you're trying to undo those changes because you don't know that I made those changes.</p>
<p>And then you add the new shit which is why I think I think for coding it would be really nice if chachi pity didn't do that.</p>
<p>I know it's like trying to be helpful but it kind of has the reverse effect because at least the way I work what i'll typically do is i'll get some code from chat gpt and then i'll sort of start fine tuning it how I want it and then i'll say I want to add this and then it feeds me the old cord back to me again.</p>
<p>Can you call but I wish it would just give me the new chord instead.</p>
<p>Otherwise cuz then I end up cherry picking okay what's new here and i'm trying to put the new stuff in cuz it's all I want.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>Are all caught back in.</p>
<p>With.</p>
<p>The new card so essentially we change the search inputs.</p>
<p>Something important in styling.</p>
<p>That we dance.</p>
<p>Default.</p>
<p>See it's saying that this is the hide input box by default but then it doesn't have.</p>
<p>Put box styling.</p>
<p>Search input class.</p>
<p>It disappeared that's why it's gone what the hell all I did was.</p>
<p>Why are you doing this to me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why that breaks up.</p>
<p>But it definitely does.</p>
<p>Am I back to square one again.</p>
<p>So there's not really a whole lot in there to be honest it's probably some of the stuff like displaying on position absolute might affect it.</p>
<p>We change talk to 85.</p>
<p>Yeah my guess would be that it's.</p>
<p>Is a display opposition that's fucking it up.</p>
<p>Also ok so what it's done as well is it's basically split this into now.</p>
<p>Right because if you look right originally it made it made a class called search input which is set to a width of 200 pixels and i'm looking at this and i'm like well it says 100% now so something else must be.</p>
<p>Like 100% of what write something else must be parenting it and yeah the rapper is now parenting it and the rapper has the width of 200 pixels.</p>
<p>So some of the styling might need to be applied to its parent.</p>
<p>All I really want to do is keep what keep in here.</p>
<p>What made it mine jeremy which was like the font size the colour.</p>
<p>The background colour.</p>
<p>The padding left.</p>
<p>The height.</p>
<p>Yes and then everything else was chat gbts.</p>
<p>So these these were the lines I added for my own customisation of it so we'll add those to the end and see if that applies.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Yeah ok.</p>
<p>So before we fix that gap by saying it was 85% top.</p>
<p>So if we change the rapper to 85% top instead.</p>
<p>Is the rapper is now the parent.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>And I don't like that being but not being button is disgusting.</p>
<p>What are disgusting button that is.</p>
<p>It looks awful it does not belong to my website.</p>
<p>How should we make it look.</p>
<p>I actually I actually feel like I don't know either an orange but because we do have like we have a lot of orange on this website.</p>
<p>Can irish button could be fun.</p>
<p>I'm even tempted just to go with like a you know.</p>
<p>An industrial boring ass grey just go with like a slightly because we do have a lot of ground this website.</p>
<p>A slightly light a shed of grey.</p>
<p>So let's start with the orange.</p>
<p>Start with the orange so if we go to.</p>
<p>Web collars.</p>
<p>On google.</p>
<p>Html colour picker.</p>
<p>Pick a call any colour.</p>
<p>Start there.</p>
<p>Why are you showing me the web call or there's the web car.</p>
<p>Black text.</p>
<p>Search button background colour there it is.</p>
<p>Let's make it that orange.</p>
<p>Ok it looks better already it looks better already.</p>
<p>Are we haven't even started well we have started with barely started.</p>
<p>Bye god that looks better already ok I wanted to be I wanted to have a bit more.</p>
<p>Oomph to it.</p>
<p>Like we did our search box so that's going to be defined by height.</p>
<p>And we'll set.</p>
<p>Pacific value.</p>
<p>So our input box was set to.</p>
<p>50 pixels.</p>
<p>I think the text should be black though.</p>
<p>So we'll set the colour to black.</p>
<p>And we want the font to be similar.</p>
<p>The input box.</p>
<p>Font size of 13.</p>
<p>Is what the input box had.</p>
<p>Let's try that.</p>
<p>Look at that I also think maybe it should be bold.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>Monster rat or whatever you know why I picked it as well because it sounded like monster and I was like that looks like monster from genshin impact so that's what made me try I was like ok let's see what that one looks like and I liked it and I was like.</p>
<p>Montserrat apparently.</p>
<p>Some french.</p>
<p>Oh look at that that is beautiful.</p>
<p>Scaring me.</p>
<p>Who sang.</p>
<p>How old is too thick I wish there was something in between.</p>
<p>But if I have to.</p>
<p>Queen 2.</p>
<p>So you never know it might look better balls in italic.</p>
<p>It might not look sore.</p>
<p>Yeah you know what somehow that works.</p>
<p>I think bold italic.</p>
<p>Makes it look less aggressive I don't know why.</p>
<p>Feels right.</p>
<p>It feels right though.</p>
<p>Three pixels.</p>
<p>Are borders.</p>
<p>Points.</p>
<p>I don't see anything maybe it's because we don't have a a border radio says for pixels.</p>
<p>Yeah if we put a border around it for some reason it looks thinner and it becomes square.</p>
<p>Oh that's nice.</p>
<p>That's quite nice though maybe it's a bit too much.</p>
<p>So by the radius rounds it off actually.</p>
<p>Increase the height compensate for that.</p>
<p>That looks cool alright so we got our in the first set up right but didn't do anything yet.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where to search should be there though it should be next to a barrel or something or even before about.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Yeah I do wonder if maybe search being on the far right is weird.</p>
<p>That's probably fine.</p>
<p>That looks that looks sick it really does i'm really happy with that.</p>
<p>My site is on github pages and therefore.</p>
<p>Has to be static.</p>
<p>How can I add search functionality.</p>
<p>How can I ask.</p>
<p>Sell my ass.</p>
<p>Cities on github how can I add my ass.</p>
<p>How can I search functionality.</p>
<p>Server-side search functionality directly however there are several options for implementing search on a static site hosted on github pages.</p>
<p>You can use it javascript.</p>
<p>Client side search.</p>
<p>So you basically create a json file.</p>
<p>Which stores the content of your pages.</p>
<p>Next yeah ok I think I get how that would work.</p>
<p>But that's the thing right is my so the way the way thing about my website is it's actually all a big massive illusion.</p>
<p>Everything links somewhere else right so that tutorials are on youtube the project files are on github the downloads come from github.</p>
<p>What are we searching for germany.</p>
<p>Yeah the only thing to search would be the transcripts so for doing jazz on searching with javascript.</p>
<p>Unless I can dump everything from transcription.</p>
<p>You can use third party search services.</p>
<p>Algolia doc search offers a free service for open source projects it crawls your site and provides a search api you can use we can have a look at that.</p>
<p>Lunar javascript the client side search library that can index your site content and search through it's suitable for small to medium sized websites.</p>
<p>Search ios family swift type provides a search as a service platform and they have a free plan for small sites.</p>
<p>There's also google custom search you can use yeah i've used that before but it's.</p>
<p>It depends how index the site is.</p>
<p>Depends whether google is fully indexed the site or not.</p>
<p>And I think the downside to google search is they they splatter adds all over it as well.</p>
<p>Let's check out this algolia doc search.</p>
<p>Algolia search as a service show users what they need.</p>
<p>You need a.</p>
<p>Jaw reduction.</p>
<p>6 miles like what you doing.</p>
<p>Who credit card requires I should bloody hope not.</p>
<p>Sign in with github.</p>
<p>We could do that.</p>
<p>John I will take you for will take it for a spin.</p>
<p>Let me grab.</p>
<p>The lincoln opening firefox because.</p>
<p>Where it's not firefox it's.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>Sign up with github.</p>
<p>I'm already in get home but you bastards.</p>
<p>Are you bastard.</p>
<p>You're bloody horrible bastards what is my.</p>
<p>Authorise algolia.</p>
<p>Do I want to accept.</p>
<p>The terms of service.</p>
<p>Do I write code.</p>
<p>I'm not programming your website for you.</p>
<p>What best describes your industry.</p>
<p>What does a steel they used to be a strong steel industry up the road but all the jobs went across to other parts of europe.</p>
<p>Does definitely a prostitution industry.</p>
<p>If you go a few blocks down.</p>
<p>I don't know really.</p>
<p>Do you use any of these platforms.</p>
<p>Just gone.</p>
<p>Jesus christ why don't you know it's ok I think you I think it's.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>How do you want to import data.</p>
<p>To see our goal is platform capabilities in lightning fast.</p>
<p>Implementing your algolia search application install api client installer api client using npm.</p>
<p>That's no it isn't it javascript.</p>
<p>How fucking hell.</p>
<p>Do I even have npm installed on here.</p>
<p>I actually do.</p>
<p>New minor version of npm available.</p>
<p>Run npm install.</p>
<p>To update.</p>
<p>Rather badly.</p>
<p>It would appear.</p>
<p>Who's missing half his body parts.</p>
<p>22 packages are looking for funding.</p>
<p>That's hilarious.</p>
<p>Any console.</p>
<p>I didn't expect like.</p>
<p>Requests for donations and money in my freaking command prompts.</p>
<p>Ok so then we can add records to index fetch your data from your database I don't have a database it's a static site you fool.</p>
<p>Shuffle movie data set to get you started.</p>
<p>Can I just crawl my website.</p>
<p>Quick start file upload use sample data set explorer movie data set.</p>
<p>I am so confused.</p>
<p>I thought I could just crawl the.</p>
<p>And have it do it automatically this is this seems like it's more gear towards like.</p>
<p>Pl sql databases.</p>
<p>Set management systems like wordpress.</p>
<p>Not so much static html.</p>
<p>Let's have a look this is kind of bullshit.</p>
<p>Static site.</p>
<p>Al galera.</p>
<p>Script static site with algolia.</p>
<p>How to scripts that excite from gatehub action using algolia.</p>
<p>Source projects have moved to it's free doc search project when you search vue press documentation you are using alcohol is back-end same with yarn dock sandwich and many others.</p>
<p>Ok set up algolia app.</p>
<p>First I created a new argola account which i've done create a new application to host my experiment.</p>
<p>Play applications something meaningful.</p>
<p>From account applications page after creating it.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Rename it to something meaningful.</p>
<p>My first application.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm not 10.</p>
<p>Rename that how about.</p>
<p>Play compiler.</p>
<p>Play compile.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Done that now what.</p>
<p>Script test.</p>
<p>That sounds delightful.</p>
<p>Inside your application for this blog post I called the index script test the screenshot below shows the index after I have added a few records there.</p>
<p>What do you mean added records I don't understand I thought we were scrapping a static site what records are you referring now.</p>
<p>Records are database centuries we're not using a database.</p>
<p>Set up a new index inside the application.</p>
<p>For this blog post I called the index script test.</p>
<p>Screenshot below shows the index after I have added if you records there.</p>
<p>To strip any site and send results to the index.</p>
<p>Okay by index I think it means a search index.</p>
<p>Index.htm I thought it meant like a.</p>
<p>Dexter html.</p>
<p>Describe any site you should have said search index describe any site and send results to the search index we need the applications id and admin key I have tried creating a separate key following run your own scraper documentation but I was always getting index not allowed with this api key error so just grab the admin key but keep it really secret.</p>
<p>Nba key.</p>
<p>Action.</p>
<p>Results.</p>
<p>This is not a very well written.</p>
<p>Tutorial.</p>
<p>Because it says here.</p>
<p>The subtitle of this post is how to scrape static site from github action using algolia which makes it sound like you set up a github action you press run and you don't.</p>
<p>Not all this bullocks and then he's talking about installing docker and shit.</p>
<p>The simplest way to use algolia provided docker image.</p>
<p>And for that I need to install docker start docker and we'll use as a turon why is this so convoluted this is so ridiculous why can't I just give it a fucking url and say he's my website off you go.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>Like what it like all that's all it needs it can grab everything using the url like why the fuck do I do any more than that.</p>
<p>It can literally crawl a website using a url.</p>
<p>So why do we have to do all this shitai.</p>
<p>This is insane.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that the thing is basically geared towards databases and content management systems and so getting it to scrape websites static websites.</p>
<p>Is like.</p>
<p>Do things outside of its intended box if that makes sense I don't know it's too convoluted to me.</p>
<p>File upload like what the fuck would you be uploading.</p>
<p>Ok what were the other options that seems like a really terrible option.</p>
<p>Lunar dot javascript to client side search library that can index your size suitable for small to medium websites.</p>
<p>I mean what is smaller medium website mean right because every word I say now is going to get uploaded to the site so they can be searchable.</p>
<p>Would that be classed as big.</p>
<p>Simple design to be small yet full featured lunar enables you to provide a great search experience without the need for external server-side search services.</p>
<p>Ok another freaking npm thing.</p>
<p>Lunar is also available as a single file for using browsers using script tags.</p>
<p>Trading index we create a simple index on a collection of documents and then perform searches on those documents.</p>
<p>First we need a collection of documents a document is a javascript object it should have an identifier field that luna will use to tell us which documents the collection much to search.</p>
<p>I don't fucking get this this is so dumb.</p>
<p>So I would.</p>
<p>So I guess I guess if I was to try and use this I would need to create a document.</p>
<p>End call it transcript whatever for adairs transcript side have to come with my own script to do this.</p>
<p>You would have to go through my files.</p>
<p>And find each transcript and name the transcript here and then dumps and I bet I bet it wouldn't support that much text.</p>
<p>And then dump my thousands of lines of text against the text here.</p>
<p>But why.</p>
<p>Get that you have to build some form of like you know metadata or something right you need to like do something with a data but you can pull the data directly from the fucking url.</p>
<p>All of these examples why are we being asked to manually process the data from our own websites in some specific way in order to get some kind of search functionality working that just seems like extra work for no reason.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on what you're trying to do.</p>
<p>But if you just want like a fool text I mean this things called a document search right say assumed it was just going to let you like search.</p>
<p>Add search static site.</p>
<p>Ai driven site search.</p>
<p>5 tools to use search on a static site.</p>
<p>Is there any problem is that static websites hardly ever have built-in search functionality if you want to add a static search.</p>
<p>We need to index the content.</p>
<p>Create a search api to access the index and build a user interface that people can use to run search queries.</p>
<p>Programmable search engines.</p>
<p>Also known as google custom search is a handy google service that lets you that helps you add a search on a static site.</p>
<p>And this is the number one.</p>
<p>Suggestion price standard search element is free non-profit search element is free.</p>
<p>Yeah I made one of these for cat gpt.</p>
<p>Search this is how I do ai searches by the way yeah sorry I already on one I already made a custom search engine.</p>
<p>And what that does is it connects my ai to google so that when I say look up and then I ask it to look something up for me it goes through this it actually uses its own custom search engine to do it.</p>
<p>Make a new one.</p>
<p>Play compile.</p>
<p>Search specific sites or pages.</p>
<p>I'll search the entire web.</p>
<p>Image search don't care about your laws I am not a robot.</p>
<p>Can you search engine has been created copy the following cod and pest and your sight's body section where you.</p>
<p>Fox and the search results to render.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So now let's go back to chat gbt.</p>
<p>I need some javascript as well interesting.</p>
<p>Alright we're adding.</p>
<p>Harvest script to the document.</p>
<p>Self.</p>
<p>Can I just stick that in here.</p>
<p>See if that works.</p>
<p>Test.</p>
<p>Scripture.</p>
<p>Yeah I save the script.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>It don't do shit.</p>
<p>Unless the script has to.</p>
<p>Lord be father.</p>
<p>It don't do shit.</p>
<p>Ok what the hell are you talking about church dvd.</p>
<p>Yeah there anything I can think is because the script is appearing below the html.</p>
<p>Maybe it needs to be like.</p>
<p>The top of the document or something.</p>
<p>Set lights fast.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Clicking the button does nothing.</p>
<p>I tried moving the javascript to the top of the page but still nothing happens.</p>
<p>The script must be placed before your search input and button.</p>
<p>That's what i'm doing now.</p>
<p>Play after the style sheet.</p>
<p>Your gaslighting me.</p>
<p>Hear it's in the example it's given it's put it's put the actual.</p>
<p>Wait a minute ok.</p>
<p>Because it's put the script at the bottom.</p>
<p>Two scripts here right.</p>
<p>Set a the first script in mine.</p>
<p>Is its second script.</p>
<p>Which places underneath.</p>
<p>The search box.</p>
<p>And then the first reference to the.</p>
<p>It's part in the head.</p>
<p>I mean I don't really do.</p>
<p>This might be why it's not working you know.</p>
<p>Kasama menu doesn't have a head so we are pulling.</p>
<p>We are pulling menu pages through javascript.</p>
<p>In this website.</p>
<p>It's not a complete page.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>My search box is part of a menu.</p>
<p>Currently.</p>
<p>I'm lying I don't have hundreds of pages but this doesn't know that.</p>
<p>I'd rather not add javascript reference to hundreds of pages.</p>
<p>Can we do something similar and pull the script in.</p>
<p>With the menu.</p>
<p>Direct me within your menu html file.</p>
<p>I'm doing that is what i'm doing and it's not working you fool.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I have.</p>
<p>Unless this is somehow different.</p>
<p>You're annoying me.</p>
<p>We'll just sanity check and make sure it's not giving us something different this time because it does that sometimes this is gaslight gpt after all.</p>
<p>Ok so this is where all my search shit goes.</p>
<p>Rice.</p>
<p>And it gave us it all in one block like that.</p>
<p>So we'll hit save.</p>
<p>Lighting up I can't even click search now.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>What the fuck are you doing man.</p>
<p>Dav class search results only i'd search results.</p>
<p>I don't know what you're doing.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>Why you break my website.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>Do we have a clothes.</p>
<p>Can you close the lie off.</p>
<p>What year we must do well I can test it by.</p>
<p>Removing all the search stuff and then hit.</p>
<p>And then refresh my website.</p>
<p>And everything's there but the search.</p>
<p>So I didn't break anything.</p>
<p>Chachi gpt what's breaking everything.</p>
<p>And then I add the shit that it gave me.</p>
<p>Yeah and it just it fucking.</p>
<p>It's like a css issue.</p>
<p>Gcse that's irish.</p>
<p>So what was the search results.</p>
<p>It should still be part of this ul class l I class search rapper container.</p>
<p>Ok what it might be.</p>
<p>I think what it might be is the.</p>
<p>It's expecting all of the previous.</p>
<p>Elements to have been closed off I think.</p>
<p>So if we place it at the very end of.</p>
<p>We can't do.</p>
<p>Ok so some of this yeah because we want search to appear before.</p>
<p>The email address.</p>
<p>So we would need to place this pass.</p>
<p>Here I think.</p>
<p>Brexit.</p>
<p>It completely fucks the formatting up.</p>
<p>Wait a minute it's saying loading menu.</p>
<p>Html via javascript on each page and now I have to change the way that I load the menu in the javascript on each page so when I i'll be honest I lied to I said I had hundreds of pages.</p>
<p>Major I do have like you know.</p>
<p>I got a few.</p>
<p>I think it's now also saying that I need I need to change the way I load.</p>
<p>The freaking menu in now.</p>
<p>So it's still have to.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I would still have to change the way.</p>
<p>The weather manual login.</p>
<p>So here it says dav menu placeholder hours is called d I v I d menu then we've got a script.</p>
<p>Yeah it's still it's still fucked.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>After making these changes.</p>
<p>Please search link.</p>
<p>Appears.</p>
<p>Lower the previous.</p>
<p>Menu.</p>
<p>So I am unable.</p>
<p>To get to it.</p>
<p>When I try to hover on as the menu above.</p>
<p>Sounds like the search input box and button are being hidden by other elements no stop gaslighting me that is no search box.</p>
<p>Okay the search box appears when.</p>
<p>Your mouse over the link.</p>
<p>Is not supposed to be a search box.</p>
<p>And this is like severely butchering my website.</p>
<p>I want to get it back to.</p>
<p>Back to before when I asked it how do I implement this fucking google search now into my button.</p>
<p>Do the search.</p>
<p>That's the thing when did I last back of this up.</p>
<p>The deeper I go into this rabbit hole.</p>
<p>I will just try it because whatever is it giving me all the css for all the starting from search container.</p>
<p>So yeah the hall of the search css.</p>
<p>It's giving me again.</p>
<p>What's the problem.</p>
<p>No it didn't.</p>
<p>It did not.</p>
<p>I think that's what it was I have no idea.</p>
<p>Put my index back to what it was my menu playing in to what it was.</p>
<p>In my menu html.</p>
<p>Cos honestly when I asked it the question.</p>
<p>I actually thought because it looks to me like what does this script is sing.</p>
<p>Script.</p>
<p>What is this actually look like though.</p>
<p>We don't even see anything.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to see something.</p>
<p>Should I go back to its original response.</p>
<p>It basically added an id to the bottom.</p>
<p>Says button class = search button.</p>
<p>Type to search it's given an id gsci i'd 1.</p>
<p>Input type text.</p>
<p>Ok that was there already so added it added.</p>
<p>Add an id.</p>
<p>Before placeholder.</p>
<p>To the input text object.</p>
<p>And then it added an id to the button class.</p>
<p>And an underneath the button added a.</p>
<p>Dav class search results on.</p>
<p>But I feel like is the script part is this rice so adds the script.</p>
<p>And then it basically.</p>
<p>Add added the div container.</p>
<p>For the search results.</p>
<p>Underneath the ally.</p>
<p>And it adds javascript.</p>
<p>Which says get.</p>
<p>Document get element by id.</p>
<p>Unless javascript pulling in html doesn't run additional javascript there's any reason I can think of.</p>
<p>So then I think what it's basically saying is.</p>
<p>We then run the scripts.</p>
<p>Ok so the only thing I can think of that might be broken it is because menu dot html is pulled in there we go that looks like shit.</p>
<p>That's awful.</p>
<p>Yeah so what's probably what was probably happening there.</p>
<p>Is because we were pulling the menu in through javascript.</p>
<p>When we do that the javascript won't run additional javascript probably for security.</p>
<p>Menu.</p>
<p>Testosterone booster.</p>
<p>Test my internet speed.</p>
<p>Why testicular cancer symptoms there's no way I said that.</p>
<p>And then it says no results so why is it.</p>
<p>It also says no results for time on.</p>
<p>Which I don't believe.</p>
<p>I don't know I just said time on there and it misheard me as time on so maybe.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind betting time on is there yeah this is fucking hardship so this is what this is basically what.</p>
<p>This is basically what chat gpt was trying to do to my website.</p>
<p>Like that looks like shit I said how can I get the search.</p>
<p>But what is this.</p>
<p>What's this button do.</p>
<p>I want to basically use my own button.</p>
<p>Yeah also I don't I don't even think this search things fucking working to be honest.</p>
<p>Help me search for unity.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>No results.</p>
<p>Yeah so either my site hasn't been crawled by google.</p>
<p>So the fact that it's not finding.</p>
<p>Like code.</p>
<p>Yeah just no matter what I search for it just says no results.</p>
<p>And it says search for chord on google.</p>
<p>I suppose that's what if I want to search google instead of this website I guess.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>Like what I want is I want to use the input field here and begin the search.</p>
<p>I don't know that it's worth it but where where I would go from here.</p>
<p>Reverse engineer what this button does.</p>
<p>Rice and cos all I want is for this button whatever this button does I want to apply it to this button here but rather than take it from this text box here we take it from this text box hear that shouldn't be too hard to do if we can reverse engineers button.</p>
<p>Can you find out what this button does and apply it to this button here essentially and get it to do the same thing that this button does.</p>
<p>However that's.</p>
<p>Play amount of work in and of itself.</p>
<p>Which I wouldn't necessarily mind doing.</p>
<p>From the fuck darts.</p>
<p>This search isn't even working.</p>
<p>At least not right now it's not.</p>
<p>No matter what I search for I don't get any.</p>
<p>It says customise.</p>
<p>Last updated time at 1:58.</p>
<p>Search engine name play compile.</p>
<p>Call to get caught.</p>
<p>I'll search feature settings.</p>
<p>Regent all regions it just says play compile.com.</p>
<p>I just did.</p>
<p>It says here like who even uses www..</p>
<p>Upload download annotations.</p>
<p>So like.</p>
<p>No results.</p>
<p>Some less and less even google isn't including the body text.</p>
<p>Of the web pages and it's only doing like headers and metadata.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>God dammit.</p>
<p>Yeah I suppose it's still looks fine.</p>
<p>I do like I do like how this looks like if I do if I do find a way to get search to work i'm gonna say look at this off streamlining.</p>
<p>If I do find a way to get this to work I would want to keep this look and feel cos I think this looks great.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is like i'm sure i've done this before many many years ago I must have thing now with it being many many years ago I thought.</p>
<p>I'll probably be easier than ever now.</p>
<p>I learnt wordpress.</p>
<p>I think I did use google previously I think i've messed around with some other ones as well some of the third party ones.</p>
<p>And yeah like basically you would like give them the url and let them crawl sometimes you have to manually queue like a crawl when it was updated or whatever and it would just go and index your site and then it would like you know.</p>
<p>Make a little javascript or whatever the fuck can you upload that and you good to go.</p>
<p>It's kind of weird to me that.</p>
<p>This is harder than it used to.</p>
<p>15 years ago whatever the fuck.</p>
<p>Weird.</p>
<p>Yeah weird.</p>
<p>Javascript which is a really nice little trick it works great for this menu.</p>
<p>The problem is if you pulled out if you pull html in with javascript you can't run additional javascript through that.</p>
<p>Pitch.</p>
<p>Which kind of makes sense.</p>
<p>Make for security reasons.</p>
<p>Rolling html in.</p>
<p>Javascript.</p>
<p>Randomly like that yeah maybe.</p>
<p>I mean the whole thing is pointless anywhere right because like at the moment because.</p>
<p>The google search engine that we've set up.</p>
<p>Doesn't work.</p>
<p>It's it's not finding anything on the site.</p>
<p>So despite all all the work that went into this I mean it wasn't that much work but.</p>
<p>This whole thing.</p>
<p>Owl we tried.</p>
<p>Can we tried.</p>
<p>Make a sound might look at it tomorrow stream.</p>
<p>I kind of like the idea though again this is what I do sometimes I like sometimes I do things that seemed utterly pointless and.</p>
<p>But the point to it is that I have an idea and i'm like ok I really want to get that to work.</p>
<p>Dislike there is no why it's just doing it because I want to do it it's like I want to.</p>
<p>I want to figure out how to.</p>
<p>Have a search engine built into the static size cos i'm pretty sure I can solve that.</p>
<p>There's literally no reason to for the site because.</p>
<p>Essentially it's just a collection of links really.</p>
<p>Add a couple of games you can play.</p>
<p>And then if we make it work by just loading that pitch directly.</p>
<p>Apparently there are never any results so what if we even like what if we search for like like finch ball is the name of one of the freaking pages right if it finds nothing for finch ball then this thing is actually useless.</p>
<p>No results for finch boil like I don't get a maybe there's something I can do to get this to work I don't know.</p>
<p>What's the name of this thing.</p>
<p>Programmable search engine.</p>
<p>Right if you are not seeing a particular result that you expect make sure you have included the result of the pattern.</p>
<p>Write down my window.</p>
<p>Make sure you've included the result of.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>It's not going well a day is it.</p>
<p>Make sure you include the results of the pattern matching the result in your search engine beware of spelling mistakes.</p>
<p>What do you mean by that.</p>
<p>Make sure the page you expect to see is in the google index a simple way of checking is to do a search.</p>
<p>On google with site operator along with a few words.</p>
<p>What if it's not in google's index.</p>
<p>Nobody can force google to index anything but there are many ways to make it easier for the search engine to discover crawl and index your urls this is where the submit url through google search url inspection tool.</p>
<p>Presents on google.</p>
<p>Are you going to say no you're not on google give.</p>
<p>Like it says here though you can do site call on so let's just test this so if we go.</p>
<p>If we got sight.</p>
<p>Imdb.com.</p>
<p>Mel gibson.</p>
<p>So now let's try.</p>
<p>Play compile dot calm.</p>
<p>Finch bowl.</p>
<p>Where that's not working properly.</p>
<p>It's all youtubers.</p>
<p>So you can't have a space yeah so my sight is an index then why the fuck not.</p>
<p>Alarm.</p>
<p>I was going to log into my door memes for a second and see if there's anything stopping the door.</p>
<p>Website dns email.</p>
<p>Dennis is working.</p>
<p>Dls.</p>
<p>Api access.</p>
<p>Cloud flight dns ssec.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know i'm not sure why that's not indexed.</p>
<p>Why is my size not indexed on google.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Again it's trying to sell me services.</p>
<p>It's been up for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>If your website or pages new it might not be in our index because we haven't had a chance to crawler index it yet it takes some time after you post a new page before we crawl it.</p>
<p>Search console.</p>
<p>Yeah it hasn't.</p>
<p>Hasn't indexed site at all so that's why i'm not getting any search results from google.</p>
<p>Dammit.</p>
<p>So this will probably work once google indexes the site so we can we can look at that.</p>
<p>Bathroom.</p>
<p>Yeah that that fix thing is breaking boo.</p>
<p>I don't know why.</p>
<p>It's one thing after another really is.</p>
<p>What might be happening now.</p>
<p>What's happening now actually.</p>
<p>I think I do know what's happening now.</p>
<p>What might be happening there is.</p>
<p>We reset the bones when it's enabled.</p>
<p>Which sets the initial position to.</p>
<p>Transform local position the problem is.</p>
<p>On enable is probably running before start so this information isn't being set mine is a couple of words actually it's knees and even.</p>
<p>So what we could do is make a private bill.</p>
<p>Which I set allah reset false and then i'll say if allow reset.</p>
<p>Then reset bonds I know what we'll do is we'll do a private void.</p>
<p>On disable.</p>
<p>Where we set alarm reset to true.</p>
<p>What that should do is ensure that the.</p>
<p>Weather stores the initial position in memory before we try to apply that position to the model.</p>
<p>Right so we'll bring him back.</p>
<p>Ok that should be fine.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on him.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>It's began.</p>
<p>John it's began.</p>
<p>2003 mars.</p>
<p>Was this.</p>
<p>Is this extra that we all this extra that I have an accountant for.</p>
<p>Games come award 20.</p>
<p>Once again showcasing the chance to vote on the global stage from august 26th to 30th will be giving away a total of 1000 primer gems as a token of gratitude so that's an extra what is that.</p>
<p>Anniversary awards.</p>
<p>The drill girl.</p>
<p>Samaro.</p>
<p>I don't see my I don't see my commissions anywhere.</p>
<p>What's happening.</p>
<p>Are there in fontaine they're just in the south side and see them.</p>
<p>Started to show all of my characters I got so far in engine.</p>
<p>I can't do it in the water.</p>
<p>That was just a bit of a murderous warm up.</p>
<p>Battle pass is ended.</p>
<p>Do we have a banner.</p>
<p>23 hours and 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Turn on the bottom.</p>
<p>Can close now.</p>
<p>We got a new pet.</p>
<p>What is.</p>
<p>Still quiet.</p>
<p>Where we going now.</p>
<p>1,500 m that's quite far.</p>
<p>Don't mess my camera.</p>
<p>Stop alarm.</p>
<p>1,100 m.</p>
<p>You can actually do this from the ground it's actually easier.</p>
<p>She's too short to get above the brailes.</p>
<p>That's the problem.</p>
<p>Go on.</p>
<p>So you can order sprint by holding sprint for like a couple of seconds and then letting go and then you can.</p>
<p>I'm guessing probably because you can die by running out of stamina in the water.</p>
<p>Waterfall.</p>
<p>You might be able to do it from.</p>
<p>Can you vella.</p>
<p>Not showing you vale there isn't it wherever I don't check new bell but there's one in the little islands.</p>
<p>The newly added island between leeway and fontaine.</p>
<p>Actually not as what there is one in fontana at the bottom I think because they put it there so you can get across to the island I don't know actually because I remember gliding over I think I did also noticed that there was a lot.</p>
<p>Are they don't think it's the same water is it it's not the water isn't connected I don't think.</p>
<p>Set alarm.</p>
<p>Yeah there's a wave rider here.</p>
<p>And you can get that little island petra car but the problem is this body of water doesn't connect you to in a zoom of the inner zoom is on the other body of water.</p>
<p>I can't get you still have to travel through.</p>
<p>I could do if you want.</p>
<p>Do you want me to jump.</p>
<p>To join your world today.</p>
<p>I don't have to lower my world level if you wanted to join my name.</p>
<p>I could get my foreigner if you want me to I can get my farina get away of ryder from inazuma and sell it over to you in leeway.</p>
<p>And drive to inazuma but the game might teleport you out if you're not meant to be.</p>
<p>Stop when you're getting to inazuma.</p>
<p>Do you want me to do that do you want me to bring you all over.</p>
<p>I'm kind of curious if you can do it or not.</p>
<p>Earth topeka.</p>
<p>There is another way you can do it do you want to do you want to know the other way to do is.</p>
<p>This is crazy shit now.</p>
<p>Ok you need this rough dear.</p>
<p>And you have to.</p>
<p>This is not that.</p>
<p>There's nothing to do with ice.</p>
<p>The reason you used cars there's something weird about kai's collider are they used to be.</p>
<p>You can clip through the ocean.</p>
<p>You basically got to be really careful they got.</p>
<p>What are you looking for is k is going to get stuck in some weird falling step between the raft.</p>
<p>And this wharf.</p>
<p>Is in that state just plunge attack down.</p>
<p>Land on the sea bed.</p>
<p>That was super fun now.</p>
<p>Let's try one more time.</p>
<p>Yeah he still he still gets stuck.</p>
<p>As long as you're not modifying the game you can do anything you want if you can do it in the game with no mods and no changing of the card.</p>
<p>I'll never get banned.</p>
<p>Because that's up to them to patch it it's up to them to.</p>
<p>Fix that broken chord.</p>
<p>Yeah that's interesting so it used to what used to happen.</p>
<p>Sort of there are lots of.</p>
<p>Falling animation.</p>
<p>Did you pass the game like all the time they're always.</p>
<p>Any little exploit that they find.</p>
<p>Even silly ones like keep.</p>
<p>Dressing room.</p>
<p>How do I change it to.</p>
<p>I don't think this will make any difference.</p>
<p>When you plunge attack from that state now you bounce up.</p>
<p>Ocean.</p>
<p>Yeah you can't do it now.</p>
<p>Masterchef.</p>
<p>Ring stairs.</p>
<p>And he's still didn't go down.</p>
<p>Thomas.</p>
<p>Turn myself and see if I could get to a zero I managed to do it once.</p>
<p>Tyre glitch.</p>
<p>Are you going to show the actual glitch or not.</p>
<p>If the water detects that you fell underneath that.</p>
<p>So what you have to do.</p>
<p>What you have to do to avoid that happening is you have to run in a zigzag and if you run in a zigzag for whatever reason it doesn't detect that you're underwater and you have to run in a zigzag until you get past the bridge and then the detection seems to not be to start playing and then you can just get to the edge of the map which is halfway to win a zoomer and then from there you have to like.</p>
<p>Use your geo traveller or something to like.</p>
<p>Which is a cross to get the wrestler.</p>
<p>It would teleport you back.</p>
<p>It seems to like just push you.</p>
<p>Doing something to like you know.</p>
<p>How well.</p>
<p>You have to be seen.</p>
<p>Why so desperate to get there in a zoom early anywhere.</p>
<p>It's easy to forget.</p>
<p>And where's the nearest wave rider I can get here.</p>
<p>Probably redial thank.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>Toward 10 cm.</p>
<p>I mean kind of similar to wear but like you know much more efficient.</p>
<p>And also like lamb and look at that you can see you can see where when a skill cooldown ends.</p>
<p>You got about 10 seconds or so after that as well.</p>
<p>Still takes a while.</p>
<p>45 minutes.</p>
<p>I don't know because I don't know.</p>
<p>I assume they lifted the storms because.</p>
<p>I used to try this.</p>
<p>In my mind i'm pretty sure they still wouldn't let you do this.</p>
<p>Storm because the law said so.</p>
<p>Story or whatever.</p>
<p>Yes i'm well there you go then I might get teleported out trying to do this as farina in your world I don't.</p>
<p>You're interested to see how it works.</p>
<p>I didn't realise that's what was happening in terms of the story.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Yeah but back back before.</p>
<p>I had cleared the storm or whatever back when they were teleporting you out of here.</p>
<p>I did manage to get through one time.</p>
<p>14.</p>
<p>Jesus christ I can't believe I fucking long on this text.</p>
<p>This is in a zoom alright.</p>
<p>Am I still i'm still that far away i'm only really fucking half weather.</p>
<p>Now now that you've pointed that out.</p>
<p>I remember feeling a bit shit about the fact that you know this is a great open world game and they wouldn't.</p>
<p>Turn the sound up.</p>
<p>Other than teleporting now.</p>
<p>I thought I kind of ruined the whole point of it being an open world game.</p>
<p>But I guess.</p>
<p>Did you did you put a lot of attention in the detail of the scam so I guess if there's a genuine story reason for and then you get to a point where that no longer applies because the story makes it sore and I guess that's kind of cool.</p>
<p>Ok well how are we going to stop people.</p>
<p>Coming to and from leo well whatever.</p>
<p>Is that dragon spine.</p>
<p>Is that celestia that one.</p>
<p>Search amazon.</p>
<p>I mean you can basically I mean if you look at the map right I can basically take my jet chamber.</p>
<p>Anywhere from like a magician what the fuck.</p>
<p>My wave rider anywhere from the top of stardew valley along the along dragon spine.</p>
<p>How long do you have right there now as you can see.</p>
<p>Can you unlock.</p>
<p>When were you might be able to do it.</p>
<p>It's something to do with ping.</p>
<p>People that sean videos where they were able to escape the teleporter by having a really really low ping.</p>
<p>Play solo that like I guess it couldn't I don't know.</p>
<p>It didn't disconnect them at the same time so.</p>
<p>I think that might be how I got that one time.</p>
<p>You're too shallow you'll get it stuck in you can't move out.</p>
<p>I'm stuck.</p>
<p>I'm also freezing the death.</p>
<p>Are the season healers in a boat article.</p>
<p>See you even heels is an abort.</p>
<p>I can pick a letter what I want.</p>
<p>So you can't freeze to death in a wave rider then I guess.</p>
<p>So whereabouts is that i'm going to be doing on.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>No I think about this.</p>
<p>I don't know I think I feel like they might build it off of fontaine.</p>
<p>Are they might build it to the west of the desert actually that would make more sense.</p>
<p>Because if it goes from green lush.</p>
<p>To desert.</p>
<p>Make volcano nutland.</p>
<p>Are there would have built.</p>
<p>That would make the most sense I think.</p>
<p>How cool would that be you go through the desert and then.</p>
<p>Cosmo or anything.</p>
<p>I think it makes more sense to put desert in between.</p>
<p>It might be like another inazuma where it's like far away from the ocean because volcanoes are obviously meant to be like you know like hawaii volcanic island.</p>
<p>It should technically be.</p>
<p>Lights on ireland.</p>
<p>And they have gone for like a summer island vacation theme as well haven't they saw that my that might add up actually.</p>
<p>So like I said near the desert.</p>
<p>Make sail out to.</p>
<p>What islands.</p>
<p>Can I get the weather out in the wind nation city leg.</p>
<p>And in the map cuts off here.</p>
<p>In the north.</p>
<p>Forcing you to go west.</p>
<p>Start start up.</p>
<p>It's like a guided.</p>
<p>Ocean tour.</p>
<p>Be careful not to get to.</p>
<p>Just.</p>
<p>I do wish they would get rid of the boss stamina bar I don't really see the point in that.</p>
<p>I don't know what the point that was.</p>
<p>Get a bit close to land.</p>
<p>Has monster obviously in the background.</p>
<p>In the distance.</p>
<p>Search for the core strand.</p>
<p>I wonder if that's the heart ireland.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>Is poem on still.</p>
<p>Is snow brakes still open on sunday I shouldn't.</p>
<p>Sometimes they have these stupid little.</p>
<p>Launch a track guns that star running.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know i'm sure why.</p>
<p>How could you possibly do that it's up a giant waterfall.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<p>The tv still showing.</p>
<p>How the fuck did i.</p>
<p>I think it's because it takes over.</p>
<p>Can you drive the frames through the assistant and that way if the assistant chang.</p>
<p>Yes it looks like a nice little trick as well if you want to survive forever in dragon spine.</p>
<p>As you can just.</p>
<p>And then you can't freeze the death.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know why I didn't ask me.</p>
<p>Why didn't you text genshin I have no idea.</p>
<p>Are you know what it might be because I said I said no.</p>
<p>Yeah I think that might be a bug if I say no to a game.</p>
<p>And I said no to snow break.</p>
<p>I don't think it asks me again after that.</p>
<p>Yeah I think that is what's happening.</p>
<p>Flickr.</p>
<p>What mind.</p>
<p>Everything was fine here.</p>
<p>Nothing ring.</p>
<p>It's just you pick up.</p>
<p>Not taking any damage.</p>
<p>Seems to not affect the way of ryder.</p>
<p>Which is a nice little.</p>
<p>Cheat.</p>
<p>Alexandria is not saying the streams flickering now.</p>
<p>What's the difference.</p>
<p>Gaslighting.</p>
<p>Dragon stein.</p>
<p>Yes dragon stein.</p>
<p>And find ourselves.</p>
<p>We can chill when we get out of chilli dragons b.</p>
<p>Yeah it's so good.</p>
<p>If you start attacking things like killer charles cos all the enemies in this game drown in water.</p>
<p>Just.</p>
<p>Pressing alarm buttons.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Where is that just floating out in the water.</p>
<p>I don't remember that.</p>
<p>I do not remember these.</p>
<p>Wait hang on a minute.</p>
<p>This is weird does a thing down there.</p>
<p>Will I to chat with happy but switching now why are you talking about.</p>
<p>Yeah what the hell's going on here so there's a thing here.</p>
<p>What is going on.</p>
<p>I never even knew this was a thing that's so weird I wonder what the hell is the point in that.</p>
<p>Just like normally they would have an element on them right and there's no way you can get to that.</p>
<p>Can I welcome back.</p>
<p>How's it going.</p>
<p>Yeah that's so weird so.</p>
<p>Where is that.</p>
<p>So there's actually one of these elemental.</p>
<p>Are you congrats congrats.</p>
<p>Yeah there's like an element or podium here in the water.</p>
<p>That's so weird I would like I wonder if that's even just like you know when dev's work you know making designing the thing.</p>
<p>Guesses.</p>
<p>What guess what element the things supposed to be.</p>
<p>I'm in unless it did end up there I don't know if so long ago that I did leave her.</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe.</p>
<p>I do remember briefly out near this hut and there was a puzzle somewhere.</p>
<p>Can you have to like fly up and get a high drugless I guess it would have been a geoculus.</p>
<p>Maybe something with podiums.</p>
<p>Got a while ago.</p>
<p>Well you can't get to it because it's on the water.</p>
<p>My my best guess is that it's either leftover from like.</p>
<p>Previous puzzle.</p>
<p>Because if you.</p>
<p>Will even if you did it's underwater so that the fire wouldn't reach it you know.</p>
<p>It's definitely not like a puzzle.</p>
<p>Please because it doesn't have an element on it.</p>
<p>And it's underwater right so there's no way you could ever interact with that.</p>
<p>But I do wonder if maybe.</p>
<p>Is leftover from like a previous puzzle like so like in the past it was interactable yeah let me know pikachu early in the game right.</p>
<p>Let me know if there's if this is in your world and if you can interact with that maybe maybe I already cleared it.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>Even when you complete them.</p>
<p>Yeah I well I don't think I don't think any of them can do anything with it because I mean if you think about it there's no way could be water because water.</p>
<p>It's literally submerged in water right now.</p>
<p>I don't think it's active that's what i'm saying it's like my two best guesses is that it's it is meant to be there but it was like.</p>
<p>It ended up looking like that.</p>
<p>It ended up looking like that when it was completed or maybe it's just left over from the dev's like the dev's might have just forgotten about it.</p>
<p>The reason I can't do anything with it as well write like let's say I want to use navi now to use geo.</p>
<p>So is kind of curious.</p>
<p>Will I gathered that.</p>
<p>Because peter 90 pic I can't just take his punishments.</p>
<p>And say i'm sorry.</p>
<p>I'll be here.</p>
<p>More chaos and destruction.</p>
<p>Yeah like I said i'm not going to be able to because by the time you get close enough to it you already in the water.</p>
<p>I can't summon anything.</p>
<p>Are maybe maybe it used to be you know like you used to be able to interact with it but when you cleared it like it's sank or something as part of the story of the game or something I have no idea.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Hydro ig.</p>
<p>Hydra and yam.</p>
<p>Yeah whatever it is it's not important because like i've already 100% and everything in.</p>
<p>You know how you how are you meant to ever get that.</p>
<p>Previous.</p>
<p>Switch back to my normal team.</p>
<p>Stourbridge with kaya and then after use barbara you want some.</p>
<p>But if you think about it right if it is activated by water.</p>
<p>It would have been on already because it's submerged in water right.</p>
<p>Sorry I think water is the last element it could be but I could that's not a bad idea I could use ice bridge and then try hitting it with their elements but i'm pretty sure nothing travels through water.</p>
<p>Like a baby like a whining little baby.</p>
<p>What element do you want me to try.</p>
<p>You said barbara I could use cock me.</p>
<p>But I don't think water will work because it's already in water i've got clever pyro we can try that.</p>
<p>Let's use these for now and then we can try different elements.</p>
<p>Barbara will barbers the same element as cook me you know.</p>
<p>Barbara where are you.</p>
<p>Cook me is a good healer.</p>
<p>Oh shit I got distracted by chat.</p>
<p>Yeah I know I heard you the first time picker i'll tell you on youtube as well if you don't stop being annoying.</p>
<p>I already read your message sorry boo.</p>
<p>And I said she is she's probably the best I like seizure as well i'll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Who's the better heal up at cj's mothman.</p>
<p>Where is this thing.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm pretty sure none of these elements actually we can start with kayo and see if we can freeze it then right.</p>
<p>But I don't think I don't think it's active or anything.</p>
<p>The element just sits on on the water.</p>
<p>Where are you aiming car that is not where I was aiming ok I need like a view of it that's the thing.</p>
<p>Where are you aiming boy.</p>
<p>You stupid clown.</p>
<p>Oh my god he's literally not that's so weird he's just aiming wherever he wants.</p>
<p>You can't stand on the bottom.</p>
<p>Yeah it's really annoying ok we can get close to it here.</p>
<p>How close can we actually get to that.</p>
<p>I don't think.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't think any I don't think any of the attacks.</p>
<p>Ever go through what I think they always stab of water.</p>
<p>And you said barbara so just to watson from.</p>
<p>Oh my god you were right how the hell were you ever meant to do that oh my god you were right i'm actually mind blonde.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Because number one it didn't have an element on it.</p>
<p>A number two it's already in water.</p>
<p>Oh my god i'm so.</p>
<p>I'm so mind blown.</p>
<p>You are right you are I doubted you it just does cos that doesn't make any sense to me at all.</p>
<p>Yeah that makes no sense though.</p>
<p>Why do you have so many channel points.</p>
<p>Right you are annoying with those.</p>
<p>New rule.</p>
<p>Create a dashboard.</p>
<p>We're going to go into rewards channel points isn't that.</p>
<p>Where the hell is channel points.</p>
<p>Alright bye.</p>
<p>Highlight my message.</p>
<p>Ok inflation is a bitch.</p>
<p>Play 150 unlock a random submit.</p>
<p>Inflation is a bitch.</p>
<p>Send a message in sub orni mod.</p>
<p>That should be at least 500.</p>
<p>What do you think double double price should we double the price or should we go higher.</p>
<p>How many channel points have you got alexander and 600.</p>
<p>As a lot.</p>
<p>How about getting 2000.</p>
<p>Redemption cool down 5 minutes it's only got 5 minutes on it.</p>
<p>Right I think.</p>
<p>20-minute cool down on all of these.</p>
<p>Would be better.</p>
<p>20-minute cool down.</p>
<p>Can pause.</p>
<p>10,000.</p>
<p>2500 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Keep it 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Ai angry.</p>
<p>25000.</p>
<p>What did I say 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Cat night.</p>
<p>30 minutes.</p>
<p>Cat psycho.</p>
<p>30 minutes.</p>
<p>Honey.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah I think it might already be higher.</p>
<p>Alright thank you for joining and I will see you next time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Am I stupid.</p>
<p>10 minutes will turn up to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah ai echo I think it's already at 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Really really annoying.</p>
<p>Ok and wiki these are the ones these bums wiki 10 times the cost.</p>
<p>Sorry at 20 minutes to make it 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Bye-bye.</p>
<p>Tell us a joke 60,000.</p>
<p>Three 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Is that what I said this one too.</p>
<p>Angry is 25 they've all been it looks like they've all got it now yeah they've all got 10 times the cost now and they've all got like at least half an hour cool down on them.</p>
<p>Should we battleship now.</p>
<p>Well there you go I never I genuinely thought that was like a mistake cos that's what I was that's what I was expecting to see was the element write the element lights up but I guess.</p>
<p>What's the element doesn't light up until you activate it or whatever and what I never would have thought water because it's already in water.</p>
<p>Yeah I think you can get a bit much.</p>
<p>Can you get like you say you get tons.</p>
<p>Thousands of points.</p>
<p>Make having him.</p>
<p>Having him react and you know make it interactive and stuff.</p>
<p>That's pretty cool.</p>
<p>We're getting there I fixed this I fixed these bugs like I think I think auto ads works for the most part.</p>
<p>What does work I think I fixed is the broken neck problem that I was having.</p>
<p>Can I get out.</p>
<p>Well if you want a ton characters I see players endless cuz like so like nickel mart is quite hand.</p>
<p>So you still quit.</p>
<p>What noise do with himself.</p>
<p>I play too many of them.</p>
<p>Yeah sounds like it.</p>
<p>It's yoko he's got with yoko on or then astley.</p>
<p>Call john as well as me.</p>
<p>Next next to be wearing round glasses and singing all you need is love.</p>
<p>Timer.</p>
<p>You don't need you anymore.</p>
<p>Love is all you need yep he's going to be doing his first concert soon character to play right now see you when i'm I love cj and so much but I have a feeling some of these not on characters are going to be super fun.</p>
<p>Love is all you need.</p>
<p>Fallout mods and he was quite funny actually.</p>
<p>And they're all dead like pervy and stuff you know I need to be like.</p>
<p>I don't really want to watch that.</p>
<p>Mum and dad does this or whatever.</p>
<p>Play i'm happy for my hope I hope it.</p>
<p>I just think for me like I quite like.</p>
<p>I kind of like tecton he is he is funny and entertaining but like lately I feel like he's got he's just gotten sore full of himself and so I don't it's like oh god it's so unbearable.</p>
<p>Like I said the one video that really got me was when he made a video about oh let's see what all the genshin content creators are up to let's analyse them and i'm really it was just him like bragging about how how like popular is become and how like he was even sentenced stuff like he wouldn't even admit that like mtus guys were better than him and he was like beat him on vue number because I didn't realise that everybody's stupid and you know they can't play a game without help from this and that am I oh my good you can't even give him like credit for like making better guides in the year it's like jesus.</p>
<p>Skip that video software.</p>
<p>It's so gross.</p>
<p>His eyes full name.</p>
<p>And you said I heard him talk about his name's john that's how I knew.</p>
<p>Absolute masterpiece.</p>
<p>So yeah I mean I don't know.</p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>Yeah like.</p>
<p>Will certainly you know.</p>
<p>Dodgy especially given that they're like and the kids.</p>
<p>Put at the same time it's like nothing's ever that black and white at the same time I look at this game and I think this game couldn't have existed without that model door.</p>
<p>Like there's no way that a company could.</p>
<p>Best a billion dollars into a game.</p>
<p>Model.</p>
<p>What is colour weird.</p>
<p>Trust fund bratz cinema have more money than sense i'm all about that let them let them from the game for the rest of us.</p>
<p>But the thing I worry about is the kids that are.</p>
<p>The kids who are you know are we spending their student loans on on that and stuff like that and you know they're never going to have anything for themselves because they're.</p>
<p>See me like you know buying genesis crystals on.</p>
<p>So that's bad.</p>
<p>It's you know.</p>
<p>And if it's not you know if it's not a stupid gacha game or whatever.</p>
<p>Just spending it on something else probably.</p>
<p>I should have been better with my money or whatever.</p>
<p>But at the same time I do I do think it's.</p>
<p>Putting so much for monster finger them.</p>
<p>Janan is like like you know I think he got as far as he was he quit the game this it's so weird to me it's like ok.</p>
<p>Yeah I think so cuz I was going to say i'm only you but then.</p>
<p>I don't need it doesn't matter I just need your details.</p>
<p>Yeah do you want to maybe send me the thing on twitch message probably best the link.</p>
<p>Why did you even swipe then.</p>
<p>That is like.</p>
<p>That's so weird.</p>
<p>And you got as far as like.</p>
<p>How's samaro.</p>
<p>Are you going to start a new account on it to start all over again.</p>
<p>Search like you know.</p>
<p>I just let me just let me know.</p>
<p>If you let me know when.</p>
<p>When you're ready now.</p>
<p>Tv screens on and the genshin board is on so let me just restart that.</p>
<p>Start of the runtime.</p>
<p>Pause if I say no to changing a game over it stops asking.</p>
<p>Just had the details straight away.</p>
<p>Yeah so I probably shouldn't have done that but.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like.</p>
<p>And there is a little bit left to do in samaria where there's this.</p>
<p>But yeah I think worse than that is when parents like have their kids and stuff.</p>
<p>On social media and you know like as part of youtube channels we we saw an abusive one recently.</p>
<p>Hurting stuff sick.</p>
<p>And she's.</p>
<p>And i'm like how is this allowed to exist it's just it's so fucked up.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I think I don't even think kids should be allowed on like any any kids should be allowed on social media there's no reason for it really like I can sort of understand that because they're not opened up the videos watching was like okay a lot of parents were like so grossed out and they were seeing that like on where was it.</p>
<p>Play some video clips and stuff so must have been.</p>
<p>Accounts that are like.</p>
<p>I'm leaving likes and some of them are like really dodgy comments as well.</p>
<p>About toddlers and they were following like you know other parents who had lots of pictures of their kids and stuff and they're like.</p>
<p>You know that's not good.</p>
<p>We recommend not putting your kids on social media and i'm like.</p>
<p>Probably for the best to be honest but at the same time you know all the parents were saying well that's not right you know why should I not have I don't know.</p>
<p>Lots of memories on my kids or whatever but my argument is well you don't need it to be public.</p>
<p>And if there would have been social media back.</p>
<p>Massively regret when i'm older.</p>
<p>So but I suppose that's better than you know.</p>
<p>Involving your kids or whatever you can't consent and toddlers especially it's like.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm the same it's like I don't really get the whole I get like.</p>
<p>I think I think women as well are probably more pressured into it like if you're I imagine if you're a woman or a young girl you don't have a social media or whatever you you know.</p>
<p>Probably have to explain that I probably not fitting in as a result of that and that can be an issue.</p>
<p>Beer I can see how like avenue pictures.</p>
<p>But yeah like the thing is whenever anybody the dreaded words for me is always when somebody's like oh do you want to see my baby and like you know.</p>
<p>So like the fact that you put them online.</p>
<p>Is the normal people that I know.</p>
<p>He's the school like facebook it always baffled me like how anyone would want to do that he is my kids.</p>
<p>He's wearing go to school.</p>
<p>Please where we live.</p>
<p>This is where we're going on holiday next week.</p>
<p>I don't know chaos whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>Are the two all tuesday need.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I have no.</p>
<p>I have no go right now i'm just kind of fucking.</p>
<p>Generic like you know i'm never really.</p>
<p>Yeah that's what I mean there's nothing like.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Captivating about that world I guess.</p>
<p>Enter a fantasy definitely struggles with that I think tariff fantasy biggest mistake is that it makes its maps where too big and it struggles to fill them.</p>
<p>I mean they can actually make places look really good though like underwater looked beautiful but it was just too freaking big.</p>
<p>You know and worked in a closer like a more compacted area I think they could have worked wonders.</p>
<p>Changing in the first place the map size is more sensible like I think they have a better idea of scale but I don't think they really know what's makes like an open world interesting.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>So you've got one two three four five hits.</p>
<p>And the role of different heights.</p>
<p>You got steps going up to some of them some of them on hills some of them are on the flatland different shapes different sizes.</p>
<p>Modern modern architecture and stuff.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can show you.</p>
<p>Show it to school ideas.</p>
<p>School pictures or whatever.</p>
<p>Did you ask all the other people in a picture if they were happy to have that online.</p>
<p>Bmi like my old school our old school got knocked down and replaced with this most industrial like boring one block building and it was like you know like when you're watching harry potter.</p>
<p>And the school has such character I mean like it wasn't quite so that level we didn't have revolving staircases running but it really did have character like this and yeah okay was probably it was probably needed like you know probably was starting to fail building courses and it gets that old but I like I don't know they could have repaired it on or something i'll try at least build a building with some character but honestly the difference is night and that's like you went from this like almost magical harry potter type school.</p>
<p>With so much character in personality.</p>
<p>And you know it's just literally just looks like a big just a big block with with windows and it's like.</p>
<p>The most boring thing ever and it's just like oh my god.</p>
<p>And I wasn't the biggest fan of school but like I couldn't help but be like.</p>
<p>I don't know somewhat captivated by our old school as it just as a building and as a place it was it was.</p>
<p>It was memorable.</p>
<p>How is it still alive.</p>
<p>You don't know you don't even have to necessarily come up with something unique.</p>
<p>And it just gives it so much.</p>
<p>Persona 5 real street.</p>
<p>All year the spider gloves.</p>
<p>Spyder gloves spyder gloves.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I think she's like.</p>
<p>Is there a picture of the real.</p>
<p>Yeah I think all of these places yeah all of these places were basically in the game will basically best on like real world places even down to the detail on friends I think that's fascinating that's so cool.</p>
<p>Apparently this boat was based on this but they definitely changed it a lot.</p>
<p>The streets were blew my mind.</p>
<p>The other main street that you're in.</p>
<p>Yeah that's like that.</p>
<p>It makes it feel so real this is the one.</p>
<p>Space masters.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that they do they do break one of the cardinal rules which is called a negative possibilities to express whether the street seems to suddenly just you seem to hit like an invisible wall and you can't got any further.</p>
<p>Meant to be blocking you.</p>
<p>How else can they really.</p>
<p>Make it fortnite maybe.</p>
<p>What is a wall of fire or something.</p>
<p>Cheese in time on saying let's explore the area.</p>
<p>Oh my god it's so good.</p>
<p>And then all this kind of like.</p>
<p>Canyon stuff here that comes all the way around here.</p>
<p>What do you call a word for asthma.</p>
<p>Table landing water steps going all the way up and then even all the way up here with the waterfalls coming down in little tears ah it's so good.</p>
<p>It's so good I think it's fantastic.</p>
<p>So interesting.</p>
<p>I mean I look out there like if I hadn't been here before as well like I would look out here and i'd be like oh my god you know i.</p>
<p>It's so inviting it's so interesting looking.</p>
<p>Yeah pretty much.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah it's so good.</p>
<p>It's so good.</p>
<p>I love I love this game so much.</p>
<p>It's the best game ever for exploring.</p>
<p>So good.</p>
<p>And then you got a little wind current here so you can.</p>
<p>Temple run or something I don't know I would imagine.</p>
<p>Detail on scam is not.</p>
<p>Beard still like it's still blows my mind now like coming back here.</p>
<p>It's hard not to be impressed it's like.</p>
<p>What is playing this on mobile phone.</p>
<p>Tried breath of the wild and I got very lost.</p>
<p>What's 2 x from like called.</p>
<p>I just found it very confusing.</p>
<p>I think maybe they were trying will they maybe trying something new where they didn't want to give you too much.</p>
<p>Find your own way or something.</p>
<p>Extension has.</p>
<p>The amazing world but it doesn't just.</p>
<p>This girl who wanted me to play.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Talk to a tower I can't barely remember now.</p>
<p>Wandering like out into the wilds.</p>
<p>Frosted death three times and then quit and she was like well didn't you pick up the fur court like in the next hut.</p>
<p>Find all the stuff that she found or whatever and you know that I didn't have.</p>
<p>Set the means to survive or whatever but I was like well how the fuck was I meant another.</p>
<p>I forget how amazing this is I mean monsters.</p>
<p>Monsters monster.</p>
<p>I don't think it's breathe I mean even monsters quite pretty though when you look at the man city and everything.</p>
<p>What all of all of this game's regions of just the best level design i've ever seen any game ever I would say fontaines probably the most lackluster though I think if you take away the underwater gimmick.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that alarm.</p>
<p>Doesn't get too hung up on gimmicks.</p>
<p>To get the breathtaking scenery.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I spoke to npc at co-ordinate 159.8 x 16.7 y 1467 z.</p>
<p>And took on the commission.</p>
<p>He did not like that timer.</p>
<p>When the silk dover on youtube.</p>
<p>Where does a cave behind the waterfall.</p>
<p>So tomorrow.</p>
<p>Will login we'll do our dailies.</p>
<p>And then actually do I need to condense some rhy.</p>
<p>Serenity but I literally forgot I was doing.</p>
