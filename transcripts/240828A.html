<h3>From Live stream on Wednesday 28-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF8FjoqTzrE​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF8FjoqTzrE​</a></h3>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Ok so few things to take a look at first thing is nutlands countdown is way too big I knew it would be.</p>
<p>Because when it pops up on the screen for like a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>I kind of want it to be big.</p>
<p>When it's got less than 24 hours left.</p>
<p>It stays on the screen.</p>
<p>So what I might do.</p>
<p>Is separate that out so that has two different values for a.</p>
<p>I'm so tired if i'm this tired now what am I going to be like by 3:00 a.m..</p>
<p>Where the heck is the countdown screens.</p>
<p>Countdown ok so what we've got is we have a countdown scripts.</p>
<p>What's the time is hard coded.</p>
<p>Outputs the countdown itself is a child object.</p>
<p>And it does have scale values this one's all over the place that is the thing these see these very massively.</p>
<p>These very massively that's the problem.</p>
<p>Unless I put it in a parent container.</p>
<p>Ok so the way we can fix this.</p>
<p>So my issue is because obviously you might look at this and say well yeah ok we need to change the scaling then right the problem is every countdown notification is a different shape and size so for this particular one.</p>
<p>Actually not it's not uniform if that makes sense like it's not like you know what I mean both of these values aren't the same the slightly off from each other and we could end up with like a squashed image if we just hard coded in override values for those so the way that we can fix that is we can create an empty object which we can call c down scale.</p>
<p>Scalar.</p>
<p>See down scale so that's our countdown scalar and then what we can do make sure countdown scalar is set to a scale of 1.</p>
<p>Give the countdown objects.</p>
<p>Give the countdown object to the countdown scalar and then what we can do is in our countdown script.</p>
<p>We can link the scalar.</p>
<p>This is hard to test as well one night's not going to just change the date I guess I could just I could just change the date so we want a public transform.</p>
<p>We need a public transform.</p>
<p>Scale is fine.</p>
<p>Public transform of scalar then we can link the scalar and then what we can do is we have different.</p>
<p>We have different conditions here right if if the times less than or equal to 0 then we just get rid of it all together because the countdowns over if the countdown if dears is less than 1 then we basically keep it open otherwise.</p>
<p>Enable it and disable a certain points so this is where we can say.</p>
<p>What day is less than 1.</p>
<p>Right we can say.</p>
<p>Scala local scale.</p>
<p>He was new vector 3.</p>
<p>Have one f.</p>
<p>On f1f.</p>
<p>What that will essentially do is tell it to put the object at 100% scale so when deers is less than 1.</p>
<p>We can say local scale at.</p>
<p>0.4.</p>
<p>0.4 f.</p>
<p>0.4 f which will put it.</p>
<p>Percent of its original size.</p>
<p>Going to be in the right place so that's that's the problem.</p>
<p>What can I do.</p>
<p>It's it's behaving itself now.</p>
<p>Now that's actually pretty nice.</p>
<p>Died from the fact that.</p>
<p>Ok i'll show you how to fix this.</p>
<p>What the fuck happens.</p>
<p>I'm going to jump out the window.</p>
<p>So the script did scare it to 0.4 0.4 0.5 oh look and it's floating all the way up in.</p>
<p>Is that an animator issue though.</p>
<p>What animation is playing on the.</p>
<p>That's the countdown to animation ok so maybe the stay animation is the thing that's overwriting it.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>Why is it.</p>
<p>Why the hell is it all the way up there there's our screen it's up there.</p>
<p>Play it's trying to get to god.</p>
<p>I cannot believe how long this is taking this is an hour and 40 minutes just to shrink a graphic.</p>
<p>Yeah the the problem with this is the.</p>
<p>One day 16 hours away.</p>
<p>If I said test now.</p>
<p>It's still showing up all the way out and fucking no man's land.</p>
<p>I don't understand I do not understand why it should be like here.</p>
<p>Play too big.</p>
<p>Right so test now.</p>
<p>Why is it not playing the animation.</p>
<p>I suppose because it never wakes up right.</p>
<p>Yeah okay.</p>
<p>Yeah because we put the animator.</p>
<p>Is the weather animation controller works is on work it will play this animation.</p>
<p>Ok test now.</p>
<p>Why isn't that animation playing.</p>
<p>What should be a 10-minute job ends up being 3 hours and I don't know why it's just the way it is.</p>
<p>And how do I know it would be a 3-hour job maybe I would decide to do it off stream but like again it is no reason now it just doesn't show up at all there's no reason why any of this stuff should.</p>
<p>Take as long as it does.</p>
<p>So what is happening now so now the animation is paused.</p>
<p>So maybe we don't need to say play after that.</p>
<p>What are these speed I think.</p>
<p>Play a normalised time.</p>
<p>So even that didn't work.</p>
<p>This is so annoying.</p>
<p>Can you believe this.</p>
<p>Can you like I cannot believe this.</p>
<p>Make this so much more intuitive this is such a convoluted ass where to replant on a mission why in earth is it this complicated to get an animation and replayer play should just do it by default it should be the way around like if you want something weird like you don't want it to I don't know.</p>
<p>Give me the end of it.</p>
<p>This has caused the animation to restart.</p>
<p>However it appears to be paused.</p>
<p>So the notification is stuck off screen.</p>
<p>Do I need to call it again.</p>
<p>Set the speed.</p>
<p>Back to normal.</p>
<p>Jesus christ church and even chachi bt can't because it clearly this isn't just like oh i'm just shit it understanding the most basic things in unity.</p>
<p>It was like chachi bt wouldn't also be struggling to get this to work it's just you fucking sometimes unit is just fucking.</p>
<p>Yes apparently I also but.</p>
<p>What did you to tell me that then.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Test.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me with this shirt.</p>
<p>I I genuinely do not believe that this is.</p>
<p>I do not believe that this is really happening right now I really cannot believe that.</p>
<p>Stop playing it's still restart the animation and it's still paused.</p>
<p>There is no fucking whether this is actually happening.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>It's like banging your head against a brick wall and that's the part that's like yeah I get that like most of the time you just stick it on a child and call it a day but like I have a specific use casey where it needs to sit on the parents and it's like I can't believe how awkward this is.</p>
<p>And it's actually incentive me.</p>
<p>Oh my god it's still not doing it.</p>
<p>Gbt is just gaslighting the fuck out of me with this shit.</p>
<p>Nope same thing.</p>
<p>What a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>Why did I not even notice that where.</p>
<p>Yeah okay.</p>
<p>The good news is.</p>
<p>The animator is now behaving like an animator.</p>
<p>The bad news is.</p>
<p>I don't see.</p>
<p>I don't see our countdown being activated.</p>
<p>What the hell is linked as you are an animal.</p>
<p>Yeah you are you are able to suck correctly.</p>
<p>So why is that not enabling now.</p>
<p>Something is turning it off.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is actually it said.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Where's my test now button.</p>
<p>I guess it's not disappearing because.</p>
<p>Play a 15 hours comma as if there's more is there more that's getting cut off or no.</p>
<p>Why the hell does that end in a common isn't it supposed to say how many minutes.</p>
<p>No it's supposed to say ok it's supposed to say the number of hours.</p>
<p>That looks shit.</p>
<p>Let's fix.</p>
<p>What time is less than one day otherwise it's showing this text output is deers plus text hours.</p>
<p>Could check what's does a space on there as well so replace base with fuck off.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>So our skill was changed.</p>
<p>And we can see it's being overwritten because if we try and change it back to one.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is insane.</p>
<p>Yeah so we can see what happens when it shrinks it still.</p>
<p>We tested this right oh my god I painstakingly.</p>
<p>Even though when we tested it in the editor it was scaling from the corner.</p>
<p>Nope it's still up there.</p>
<p>And what's really weird is as we scale it now where does even weirder.</p>
<p>Now as we scale it seems to move in the third dimension right it's like it's getting closer and further away.</p>
<p>It is so bad.</p>
<p>And it's on right now and it's up there to see you again that didn't make a blind bit of fucking difference.</p>
<p>And it's weird right cuz as I scale it as it's running again scaling it when it's running.</p>
<p>It seems to just move it backwards and forwards like what the fuck but that shows how these gizmos are manipulating the.</p>
<p>Yeah it's still off the fucking screen.</p>
<p>I don't know this is fucking nuts to me.</p>
<p>This is actually nuts to me.</p>
<p>I've set the scale in the animator and the position in the animator.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>I'm actually going out on my mind.</p>
<p>Ok when I do test now.</p>
<p>Oh shit.</p>
<p>No I now have my little pony and my dad a bit.</p>
<p>Ok let's just.</p>
<p>Edit to detect jenn i'm not actually going to play against.</p>
<p>Ask me.</p>
<p>I can also change the detection rate down to 1 minute set to by default.</p>
<p>Should I fit in moderation somewhere.</p>
<p>Twitch info.</p>
<p>Yeah refresh minutes one.</p>
<p>Will it happen in runtime now.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>The longest minute in my life.</p>
<p>I can't believe 2 hours.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Ok so now.</p>
<p>Ok so now it knows I do not want to change to genshin impact so every time it detects that we're streaming my little pony but we're playing genshin impact it's successfully doesn't keep asking me everyone minute thank god because that would be extremely annoying however.</p>
<p>If the game changers again it is supposed to ask me for the.</p>
<p>My little pony.</p>
<p>You're my true brony.</p>
<p>Because you my little pony.</p>
<p>Tony bra.</p>
<p>Snow pony.</p>
<p>How much sounds like a delicious dessert isn't it.</p>
<p>Call tony.</p>
<p>Have a strawberry snow pony.</p>
<p>Knees.</p>
<p>Your life depends on this.</p>
<p>What's the thing I don't think it will.</p>
<p>I did click that.</p>
<p>Are you going to ask me or not.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>But why won't you ask me.</p>
<p>How long is this slag got left.</p>
<p>We're trying to sell me now.</p>
<p>Do you want to sell me this.</p>
<p>7% off.</p>
<p>Tetanus.</p>
<p>Just her.</p>
<p>Just her she's got a special discount right now.</p>
<p>Jesus christ you can.</p>
<p>Say on that I own that I own nuts.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>But it's more reasonably priced 48 right.</p>
<p>Is a 68.</p>
<p>128 yeah it's because the speaker is quite loud.</p>
<p>Yeah I feel like it should have asked me by now.</p>
<p>So what we have is we have a variable.</p>
<p>Call.</p>
<p>Denied id.</p>
<p>And denied id is the id of the game number that I said no to.</p>
<p>And am I logic I simply I say.</p>
<p>If the new game that you find that doesn't match the streaming game.</p>
<p>As long as it's not.</p>
<p>So unity engine denied id.</p>
<p>What is that.</p>
<p>And also we want to know.</p>
<p>Check for new dart game name.</p>
<p>What's the game name.</p>
<p>Nothing only two conditions.</p>
<p>And also check for new game ideas not the current game.</p>
<p>Game id.</p>
<p>Checkfront gamid.</p>
<p>So really that's new new game name.</p>
<p>New game id.</p>
<p>Get my day.</p>
<p>And current game id.</p>
<p>Current id.</p>
<p>Current game id.</p>
<p>Speech detection failed but I think it times out and counts as I know anyway if it turns out I think.</p>
<p>What's weird i'm not saying any I never saw any of those debug messages.</p>
<p>Skip so right now at the start.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Start the start it has.</p>
<p>Current ideas 77178 that will be my little pony properly denied ideas empty which makes sense because we haven't rejected one at that point.</p>
<p>In the next minute it should have a denied id though.</p>
<p>New game id was 15387 281 snow break in amazon.</p>
<p>So new game id should carry over the denied id.</p>
<p>Seems loud.</p>
<p>Shut.</p>
<p>I assume.</p>
<p>New game id.</p>
<p>I'm currently still 77178 ok so there's there's an issue there so the denied i'd is actually.</p>
<p>Do not i'd was new game id.</p>
<p>Thank you for some reason that's not what that's becoming.</p>
<p>Do you set anywhere else.</p>
<p>Why is my speech to text not working.</p>
<p>No no reference what the fuck.</p>
<p>How is that a no reference.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What's let me get the.</p>
<p>It's back to 2 minutes god damn it.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>No you're not my second my second.</p>
<p>Party is this.</p>
<p>Wifey wifey.</p>
<p>Yay we fix the bug.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It did but youtube rejected out.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>Ok so let's take a look at that one.</p>
<p>What year was the current stream game and not the new game so that makes sense.</p>
<p>Yep it's not break.</p>
<p>Can youtube rejected the request.</p>
<p>But I don't know whether that's.</p>
<p>I want off.</p>
<p>How's the weather to be worried about that.</p>
<p>Oh I know why.</p>
<p>I do know why yeah ok cuz youtube.</p>
<p>Because we give you youtube time to start up oh shit ok.</p>
<p>Yeah okay I do know why.</p>
<p>Because youtube hasn't.</p>
<p>Because we give it a couple of minutes to update the web page so I can get the chat id so I can get the chat room warmed up and everything else.</p>
<p>I'd have to expand youtube's api system so that we can queue and update.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess that's how I would do it is if i.</p>
<p>If I expand the system so that it can accept an instruction to wait until it's warmed up and then update the stream.</p>
<p>Like once it's warmed up.</p>
<p>But yeah that probably only happens when the thing.</p>
<p>Should really should really never happen but it does.</p>
<p>Maybe now I fixed up bug it won't happen as much anywhere.</p>
<p>I will forget.</p>
<p>Youtube.</p>
<p>Api request fails if new game detected.</p>
<p>Start of runtime.</p>
<p>Since youtube fbi not yet fully initialised.</p>
<p>Consider adding a queue where youtube.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Is youtube is youtube api still not up.</p>
<p>Would have been 4 minutes by now though right.</p>
<p>Youtube fbi.</p>
<p>Is youtube chat not working.</p>
<p>Always something.</p>
<p>Yeah also.</p>
<p>So youtube chat is working youtube fbi is up but youtube it be I request is failing as a battery quest from twitch info.</p>
<p>Line 394.</p>
<p>Where we.</p>
<p>On youtube api to update the current game and the current current title with the with the game tags.</p>
<p>So we set youtube.</p>
<p>Yes feeling every time.</p>
<p>What the fuck.</p>
<p>I wonder if I wonder if the upi.</p>
<p>How much is youtube tokens fucking expired or something I need to fucking get a new one.</p>
<p>Battery quest.</p>
<p>Request arrow bad request.</p>
<p>I really wish I wish these bloody apis would give more meaningful errors.</p>
<p>400 bad request is like so vague.</p>
<p>Give me a clue what's bad about it did it fail authorisation.</p>
<p>Was it not in the expected format give me a clue.</p>
<p>Like bad request.</p>
<p>It's like so fucking vague.</p>
<p>Jesus christ I don't know it might want a new talk on.</p>
<p>I can't even fucking think about that right now.</p>
<p>Countdown looks good.</p>
<p>Let's play some freaking video game cos i'm.</p>
<p>I need to.</p>
<p>Take a break.</p>
<p>Are you mad.</p>
<p>I'd like to.</p>
<p>Katya.</p>
<p>And the api request failing I don't think it is related to youtube if you're not being up.</p>
<p>Seems to be happening consistently.</p>
<p>I think the last 3 months I don't feel like it's been 3 months since the last it might have been 3 months since last time I will do it.</p>
<p>Right ok.</p>
<p>Did you say you need to do cob.</p>

<p>Why is the door bright yellow that looks awful.</p>
<p>That looks awful why did they choose to make it look like that.</p>

<p>It looks like textures haven't loaded properly or.</p>
<p>It's not a man.</p>
<p>It looks awful.</p>

<p>And so like I said the first the first problem that I had I went to the dentist and they just like pulled it out but it took them aids and it was so uncomfortable and I kind of thought you know I regret that I think I probably just leave it next time so that's what I did and then two teeth falling out over time but I actually feel like that was better than getting it.</p>
<p>I don't know maybe maybe not probably not.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>

<p>T-shirt and my face all right let's go.</p>
<p>47%.</p>
<p>Thank you gentlemen.</p>
<p>No i'm buying stuff.</p>
<p>What's this.</p>
<p>Who's this.</p>
<p>Who is this fine gentleman.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>It's like a highly rated one.</p>
<p>The new jews did they like remake it or remastered or something.</p>
<p>Killing old I think I prefer the original.</p>
<p>Movies of it that we're.</p>
<p>Angels and robots.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah they either run out of time or budget.</p>
<p>Which was why they made the end.</p>
<p>Gillian movie because the end of evangelion movie was allegedly what they wanted to make the.</p>
<p>How do you like.</p>
<p>How do you not disappoint you I mean how do you live up to that sort of build up and that's what I remember when breaking bad first add and I have the same thought about that I thought can he really convince gilligan really pull this off cuz like this this series is building up so well I can't help but feel that it's impossible to make this end well but I thought breaking bad but ended fantastically I was like you know.</p>
<p>If you don't meet expectations from all the promise to build up it's just gonna feel like shit and yeah they they fucked the end of that and a lot of things do that I feel lost was like that but the problem with lost was.</p>
<p>Play like hbo whoever it was just wanted to milk it for as long as humanly possible so I think right as was like explicitly told don't ever like you know.</p>
<p>Don't ever end anything don't ever give too many answers try and keep it constantly a mystery and of course at a certain point it just becomes nonsense.</p>
<p>Milk it for all it's worth.</p>
<p>So yeah.</p>
<p>And like there is a it's been such a long build up over the years that when they finally like you know they're going to have to come to something conclusion at some point I was saying.</p>
<p>And I feel like it's going to be hard to sort of not to make that feel satisfying.</p>
<p>Engines got like that weird added problem where I think it is a little bit like lost I don't think they're expecting it to be as big as it was or go as long as it's as it is so whatever the original story plans were I feel like they've.</p>
<p>Someone.</p>
<p>Trying trying to drag it out on purpose so that they can sort of fill it with.</p>
<p>I mean jesus christ honkai impact third is like 12-year-old or something at this point.</p>
<p>Not try to milk it not try to stretch it out too much from the original story conclusion.</p>
<p>And then start to think about some kind of after story for it you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Have the brother and sister reunite and then just have.</p>
<p>Conclusion just just send them on like a second story or whatever that would be great.</p>
<p>I think that would be a better direction for the game to go but I guess we'll see.</p>
<p>Are they going to have to reach that conclusion eventually so I think they should just like you know see the story out to whatever the original story is meant to be.</p>
<p>Could be awesome.</p>
<p>Right we are probably.</p>
<p>Am I not quite capped yet but.</p>
<p>Recovery past.</p>
<p>Recovery post.</p>
<p>They've given themselves a nice blank canvas to work with.</p>
<p>Put my actual.</p>
<p>You know my brain can't handle two characters beginning with the letter e.</p>
<p>Call bitch.</p>
<p>Could it figure.</p>
<p>We use dollar weakness up.</p>
<p>Okay she's slightly behind.</p>
<p>She's slightly behind so we'll get one of her feathers first I think.</p>
<p>So this is the weekly right.</p>
<p>Yeah cos I think I think maybe that are kind of fire she does have a look of chemical do you think she's supposed to be him a car.</p>
<p>But she's not she's not even that light skin to be completely honest.</p>
<p>Weather just an existing version of a character in alternate reality.</p>
<p>Yeah they normally go that way don't need but.</p>
<p>I think it's well it's weird cuz in star l they have some of the characters are actually the same characters right him because he would.</p>
<p>What age.</p>
<p>Ok so that's.</p>
<p>Should be the last of my weekly was that.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So what is electric girl need.</p>
<p>The twirlees.</p>
<p>The 2012 is.</p>
<p>Do now.</p>
<p>Where.</p>
<p>Yeah not that makes sense right.</p>
<p>I was just thinking that soil in the week and I use weekly is already but yeah normally do I normally do that because it kind of prioritise them.</p>
<p>Like if I was tecton let's.</p>
<p>Another words.</p>
<p>If I felt the need to play this on stream.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>This is a game I have just pay somebody to grind it for me I feel like right you do all these keep.</p>
<p>Play this game.</p>
<p>Outside of big measure updates.</p>
<p>And like for such a new game that's just so weird.</p>
<p>You will be gone.</p>
<p>Like first of all i'm like genuinely.</p>
<p>Wondering if that's like real or fake.</p>
<p>Just like you know even like.</p>
<p>Artificially hyped for the game when you know it's hard drive patches and you know people are burning out from and everything else because they're relying on it so much for the content creator in combats I understand that.</p>
<p>Yeah my agree.</p>
<p>What is this like.</p>
<p>Put on roman egg.</p>
<p>Idealization of this game is that like.</p>
<p>Genuine or is it fake I don't know.</p>
<p>So engaged with her.</p>
<p>When's day but for me that's today.</p>
<p>I just I just legitimately ran out of even my even my daily grind this is what so bad to me.</p>
<p>Is even my daily grind as is now fucked.</p>
<p>Because all i've got left to do.</p>
<p>These talent skills and these are time gated by weekly boss allowances and i've used up all my weekly boss mats it's tuesday.</p>
<p>So now whatever I found between now and next monday yeah between now and next monday is either me pre farming for next week's boss's marts.</p>
<p>Upcoming character that I might not even get.</p>
<p>Otherwise like what what do I do I just like stash money or something like that I mean like and that's insane to me.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>Between now and the end of next week.</p>
<p>Am I even just not log on to the well the thing is that.</p>
<p>Comes out.</p>
<p>Turn on stereo mass.</p>
<p>About.</p>
<p>For me the the bad thing about star real is it's just you just waiting for the game to play itself for the most part and it's just it's.</p>
<p>What's 2 grindy to be a game like that so I must feels like it's like I play in a similar way to kneecap that i'm really just thought of farming everything.</p>
<p>Put the different says nico you can do in like 10 15 minutes where star rail.</p>
<p>A couple of hours.</p>
<p>I think like I said all gacha games eventually descending this kind of.</p>
<p>Daily loop of doing nothing at all.</p>
<p>But it makes more sense for a game that's like you know a couple of year old or whatever.</p>
<p>Play for me that's like what they should be working on if I was a gacha game company if I was hi or whatever I would be seriously looking at my game and saying ok.</p>
<p>When are people leaving when do people bought out of the fucking minds when are they going to all the games like we need we need to give those people something to do we need to give them more reason to like stick around and not just like formal you know relying on like oh well I need the gems or whatever.</p>
<p>I would see that as a bigger as a big problem.</p>
<p>But in many ways it's probably working as intended right as long as they keep your logging in it already give a shit with you.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know what so what time will it go in a minute tonight.</p>
<p>Am I get on and do that first though cuz I know pico I don't know where peter's link when it's not a.</p>
<p>I feel like the best patch was the first summer event that they did you know we got a new map which is the one that we do star what's it called.</p>
<p>Star one.</p>
<p>That's the map we got for the first summer event and they just keep recycling it for other stuff which is fine but like jesus that was over a year ago.</p>
<p>Yeah a lot of these companies don't want to reinvest the back.</p>
<p>Costumes and characters.</p>
<p>And give them the bare minimal game that they need to give them.</p>
<p>Best thing in the game but I just think they.</p>
<p>Motivation to keep players engaged.</p>
<p>I guess i'll jump in genshin first or get.</p>
<p>I need to find those redemption chords.</p>
<p>Participle participate for a chance to win.</p>
<p>Is this a new trailer or something then.</p>
<p>They get around.</p>
<p>There is no corner of the universe that her child's name.</p>
<p>Whereabouts which side.</p>
<p>Amanda's gonna be.</p>
<p>Yeah that looks like it would be really cool.</p>
<p>To have like surfing ring you know like all almost like wipeout little races a little challenges but thinking about it can they do that because not everybody's going to have the character right.</p>
<p>Get these juicy chords.</p>
<p>Juicy juicy cards.</p>
<p>Juicy cards.</p>
<p>Not cards.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>1234.</p>
<p>How many of them have primo's does the thing.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Why didn't that stay in the clipboard.</p>
<p>The first one.</p>
<p>Yeah this is how I ended up boxing that guy's bloody login details I hate that about genshin.</p>
<p>Have to call dan in as well you know.</p>
<p>Where is default behaviour.</p>
<p>But for whatever reason they've made it so if the game loses focus in full screen mode it just shows your entire.</p>
<p>Desktop or whatever happens to be.</p>
<p>Talk to you it's details.</p>
<p>Expired.</p>
<p>What are the what are those expired already.</p>
<p>300 genesis crystal.</p>
<p>Level two.</p>
<p>Rate for when the party comes out but I don't know how much of it we get in.</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
<p>Google st patrick's day as well oh yeah.</p>
<p>Emily oh god.</p>
<p>Emily.</p>
<p>Must you be more interesting if she was hey if she was a drunk irish girl.</p>
<p>Play more exciting.</p>
<p>Where is this.</p>
<p>Talk to style still talk to stale oh my god.</p>
<p>4,800 m is quite far.</p>
<p>Good afternoon.</p>
<p>Ok luckily for rina's minions do all the work for me so I don't have.</p>
<p>And then will they update the png that's in the sky right now to an actual.</p>
<p>I swear you going to die.</p>
<p>What's a good region.</p>
<p>Yeah to two of them have expired.</p>
<p>Say new ones.</p>
<p>I should be getting I don't know where the hell i'm supposed to get it though cos I took the last streamer event that they did I registered for whatever and I worked out to be like about 5 pulls.</p>
<p>And I supposed to be delivering that in now and I have an idea but I don't know when they said I was getting it by.</p>
<p>Ok where the hell is are these commissions.</p>
<p>Where are we headed in north north of leeway.</p>
<p>As a big mountain.</p>
<p>Charcoal surf's on water and lava apparently.</p>
<p>So if melina's shark thing.</p>
<p>Work in a similar way it might feel like a bit of a downward.</p>
<p>And then same goes for drill girl right she's going to replace carrara for climbing up rocks now carrara's got a cool down which to be fair it doesn't last that long.</p>
<p>So she's not as hard to compete with.</p>
<p>I'm wondering.</p>
<p>How these new traversal skills are gonna.</p>
<p>Yes that's going what is that is that front end I may even be somewhere actually.</p>
<p>What is the distance.</p>
<p>What is the.</p>
<p>It's either going to be like something maybe there's like something on can you vale.</p>
<p>The weird little sky thing is.</p>
<p>What is that.</p>
<p>Ok there we can see it now.</p>
<p>To be honest.</p>
<p>I think that might be something in changi overall structure.</p>
<p>Interesting I never say I never come this way before it's nice.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>I think this is is this changing well now.</p>
<p>Really nice.</p>
<p>Video attached video.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>Set the.</p>
<p>Took me back.</p>
<p>First of all i'm I don't know how to play the characters that are in the roster.</p>
<p>You know you've got to rely on your own and man aren't really that bills.</p>
<p>But I don't know.</p>
<p>I guess what I should maybe do what would be a good idea I think is to try and farm.</p>
<p>A bunch of artefacts.</p>
<p>Characters.</p>
<p>A lot of characters.</p>
<p>And just do that without really paying attention to.</p>
<p>Login get into the habit of just farming them not really looking at them and just let them build up over a few weeks.</p>
<p>And then you know when I go in and i'm like ok what do we need.</p>
<p>Who do we need to build.</p>
<p>You know all the time I should end up with some decent artefacts without even really thinking about it too much.</p>
<p>Usable stuff in there.</p>
<p>It's kind of weird to do that now though because I might have another.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>I say.</p>
<p>Did I miss one.</p>
<p>Collect.</p>
<p>So well either I was a blind bind in the sea and mr complet.</p>
<p>Where does my commission on for I would completely missed that.</p>
<p>Roughly written letter.</p>
<p>You might not be able to tell a 30 fps but like especially in this area as i've come in here like my firm reads.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>How's your genshin going.</p>
<p>And would you like any help with anything did you want me to try and get that wherever I don't think it'll like me.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Literally travel the entire.</p>
<p>Length of the world.</p>
<p>How the hell am I going to get up there.</p>
<p>Climb the rocks right.</p>
<p>Go on the water in that one and I can drown.</p>
<p>Do you have a weird around here I don't think we do.</p>
<p>Pretty sure the last time I came they've added something like a little.</p>
<p>You can't do anything with him.</p>
<p>I need god you.</p>
<p>I went to.</p>
<p>What was that I went to the chasm today.</p>
<p>Call the story took me.</p>
<p>Put this time there was no teleport on the leeway side of the cousin.</p>
<p>Cos i.</p>
<p>As far as the cousin on my rear all accounts.</p>
<p>Have a complete it up.</p>
<p>And obviously on this account I just.</p>
<p>Ok so we can get up here now with these.</p>
<p>The waterfall like this which I think was is a really good idea.</p>
<p>Real game geometry.</p>
<p>Can you manage it.</p>
<p>Ups we go.</p>
<p>Yeah you know what peter you could have gotten more free pause by returning to your old account.</p>
<p>Because they're updating the salary union thing.</p>
<p>10 free poles now for coming back to the game.</p>
<p>Set an extra 10 pools you could have had.</p>
<p>Why must you tell that joke every single day.</p>
<p>Where's my.</p>
<p>It's a little bit further cry you can do it.</p>
<p>Which which book.</p>
<p>What the scarecrow.</p>
<p>I know what happens it's because.</p>
<p>So there are two there are two types of jokes there's a joke that comes from my joke book.</p>
<p>When does jokes where I do.</p>
<p>I request to open the ironside tell a joke.</p>
<p>Tell a joke it tells the same fucking stupid joke.</p>
<p>It's like it's like every time he sets the stream title right I make an api request it's such a waste of time as well i'm making a power request to the chatbot and say or suggest a good swim title for wuthering waves and every single time it suggests riding the wuthering waves or conquering the.</p>
<p>It's not always that joke but it's very often that joke.</p>
<p>What is that.</p>
<p>What are the algorithm at one of those things.</p>
<p>Yeah I mean the technology still very limited.</p>
<p>It has a.</p>
<p>It has a variable as well called.</p>
<p>A value called temperature.</p>
<p>Which is supposed to like.</p>
<p>How random it gets.</p>
<p>Let's say if it's one it'll be like.</p>
<p>More accurate answers.</p>
<p>But you have set it to like 0.4 something so it should be late you know slightly more creative than half and it's still the same fucking joke every time.</p>
<p>Jesus christ.</p>
<p>How long is that message.</p>
<p>Back.</p>
<p>Heal yourself sage when heal yourself.</p>
<p>Is quite wild you know what this world level ascension may actually.</p>
<p>Am I actually give me a real challenge.</p>
<p>That's what we're about.</p>
<p>So my assistant will change.</p>
<p>When I change games.</p>
<p>How many how much free stuff to get for new players.</p>
<p>Yeah it was dreadful.</p>
<p>Your first two temples on a noel banner.</p>
<p>So I couldn't even do that.</p>
<p>Do that pull on like you know the character banner or.</p>
<p>Standard banner or whatever just so that they can.</p>
<p>That was so bad.</p>

<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Wow nice shitter.</p>
<p>Smooth share a lot that.</p>
<p>Wow that was so.</p>
<p>Ok I think that might be where i'm heading towards that one.</p>
<p>Rabbit starts raining heavily.</p>
<p>It's probably a bad sign.</p>
<p>Sacrifice time skip for your size.</p>
<p>What's so good about getting the inazuma riley anyway just farming mass.</p>
<p>What are also do because it might help with avoiding detection as i'm going to run in zig zag.</p>
<p>Another works on the water.</p>
<p>Skill.</p>
<p>Seem to remember the storm would.</p>
<p>How about just passed the halfway point.</p>
<p>Meet you in leaway harbour.</p>
<p>Where are you want me to take the sport so you want me to take the boat away we just set off from don't you.</p>
<p>You know how to help as well.</p>
<p>Sprinting stamina reduce printing stamina.</p>
<p>Reduce burning stamina quickly.</p>
<p>Decrease sprinting stamina.</p>
<p>I mean sofa so good no.</p>
<p>No storm so far.</p>
<p>But I think it will be me that it's.</p>
<p>Isn't it that one.</p>
<p>On the hard works in co-op.</p>
<p>It depends on whether it's server side horses are peter pier client hosting.</p>
<p>Cancel about distracting me figure.</p>
<p>I work on getting to fontan in the meantime.</p>
<p>You could just play the game you know.</p>
<p>Where's it feels like you're you're doing your best to not play the game.</p>
<p>When you got a brand new girl.</p>
<p>Day and night cycle.</p>
<p>65.</p>
<p>321.</p>
<p>3 to 1.</p>
<p>Nice shadow.</p>
<p>Share the glitch.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>So that'll be interesting.</p>
<p>What are the interesting I almost you know what I almost want to do.</p>
<p>Pastor I almost want to get to wherever it is I am but then it takes some fucking long but what I would love to do ok cuz now I have a theory.</p>
<p>Me go here then my new theory is that it will kick you out when you try to sell over in a wave rider.</p>
<p>And so it's checking something on the account to see whether you're supposed to be allowed here or not.</p>
<p>In which case what I would really.</p>
<p>Get a second way rider.</p>
<p>Completely teleported.</p>
<p>I never wanted to do it once.</p>
<p>We don't know you don't know until you test it you don't know how the things being put together do you.</p>
<p>You didn't know either.</p>
<p>Pause please.</p>
<p>I have an agreed with you didn't know I said oh yeah you know what now that I realise that that's the reason for it then yeah my guess is because this game is attention to detail is insane.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't think.</p>
<p>Well the reason the reason why I assumed say I just thought that they didn't want you getting the inner zuma.</p>
<p>Every time I try to get to win a zoom like in a zoomer in in my world yeah it would even glitching out of bounds it would always kick you out like that.</p>
<p>Yes I never really tried it for ages and ages and ages because why would I need you.</p>
<p>But then when farina could walk on water I decided to test it again.</p>
<p>With farina and it let me in.</p>
<p>And so I thought oh.</p>
<p>I guess they I guess they just letting you do that now.</p>
<p>Makes sense now that you.</p>
<p>Has the same that's.</p>
<p>Play ease upon him who gives you any more.</p>
<p>Makes my sense because like if they care about the law that much before why would they throw that away right.</p>
<p>Will you explained it was laurel and I thought ok yeah that.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>So do you want help with anything else or are you not bothered.</p>
<p>Can see when just one hell is well in this world.</p>
<p>Why the fuck aren't they heading out.</p>
<p>How do you spell chests.</p>
<p>What's my alternative.</p>
<p>Is instamall.</p>
<p>She's already ridiculously.</p>
<p>Well i'm getting a lot of shit at glitches in your world that's so weird.</p>
<p>A chest associated with it but then again it lets me.</p>
<p>Kill all the enemies that i'm not call you the chest why wouldn't it let me bring them.</p>
<p>Siri is not follow me either today.</p>
<p>I do this for you.</p>
<p>I remember this.</p>
<p>I want to try and play properly as well bye.</p>
<p>Wow how old is melts everything.</p>
<p>Thank god.</p>
<p>Wait so do you want any help farming anything are you good.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>You know what's even better I think I think I did actually.</p>
<p>I think I did actually remove the api request saying.</p>
<p>You get here now you have a wife.</p>
<p>Do you have a plan or you just.</p>
<p>Kill the demon stole my boss.</p>
<p>Kill him.</p>
<p>Connect.</p>
<p>Kill it.</p>
<p>Yeah you must have really low paying or something.</p>
<p>I just saw like things appear in the map as well.</p>
<p>Can a broccoli.</p>
<p>Delete.</p>
<p>Can you make it lower lower.</p>
<p>How do you know what peak is ping is.</p>
<p>Or 2 minutes says somewhere.</p>
<p>I don't think these things ever attacked you.</p>
<p>Peaceful creatures.</p>
<p>Are you not in fontaine you're on the little you're on the little island in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>I'll get the statue once we're done with cob.</p>
<p>Yeah but why am I ok so we couldn't get past the storm but now i'm asking what do you need me find cob.</p>
<p>So I will ask you for the 14th time do you want me to help me find anything or not.</p>
<p>The way you play games is how I used to play games before I was a gamma.</p>
<p>I would run around the streets murdering random people with no real.</p>
<p>What do you want to do for me.</p>
<p>What kind of what kind of a line is that what do I want to do for you.</p>
<p>What do you want to do for me.</p>
<p>But yeah as I was saying you you play games like I used to play games when I was like.</p>
<p>11 or whatever.</p>
<p>And I would just run around aimlessly and.</p>
<p>Do randoms random stuff and then quit the game.</p>
<p>But then I started you know actually.</p>
<p>I know that sticks for.</p>
<p>How much.</p>
<p>I want to use yet except for mc.</p>
<p>I think I get i'm getting the overwhelming sense that's.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Resume.</p>
<p>500 balls.</p>
<p>When I have a look.</p>
<p>Where we failing in this.</p>
<p>Yeah this is why so the only.</p>
<p>Any good characters I have here is farina and aika maybe my barbara and that's what i've picked these are the three characters I never player I don't know how to play them i'm having to use that trial characters but yeah if we want to do better in this I guess.</p>
<p>I need to build a better diana.</p>
<p>Has another my.</p>
<p>Yeah well there might know my photos on is not better because if you look at my artefacts it shows you there my artefacts are all level zero.</p>
<p>Where my barbara oh my barbers not wearing any outfits did I give them two siege when I did the name oh shit.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>I'll be playing yoga you won't you levelling your bum anyway you know it you know you need barber wright.</p>
<p>Until you get about a healer.</p>
<p>Especially the word.</p>
<p>I don't remember being an amazing player.</p>
<p>Will I probably rebuilt I tried a lot of builds on siege when to be fair.</p>
<p>So I feel like a lot of barber's old artefacts are probably just sat in my inventory to be honest.</p>
<p>Hp that one's huge hp.</p>
<p>14.6 hp that's huge yeah all right.</p>
<p>Are tons of energy recharge I guess.</p>
<p>18.1 and you recharge and 448 hp and even a little bit of a vm that's actually really good.</p>
<p>Barbara scales off hp right.</p>
<p>That one's got.</p>
<p>Charge.</p>
<p>Yeah any of these do actually.</p>
<p>I could stick some em on her if we're using a free actions.</p>
<p>I will just take I don't know.</p>
<p>Extra hp as well as hp man start plus a bit of a m.</p>
<p>Play captain energy anywhere i.</p>
<p>How is the one I would prioritise building or anybody else just because he's a five-star I have no idea how to play him.</p>
<p>Did you even have got him.</p>
<p>Damn right.</p>
<p>Do you know is my half showers because I think I was farming like carrara cons or something.</p>
<p>So we have him.</p>
<p>So I don't know what is what's good on shower theory tests.</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>Anybody have any any recommendations for shower are we doing very essence.</p>
<p>Should I should I look it up.</p>
<p>I'm thinking four-piece very decent on showers now.</p>
<p>Xiao xiao.</p>
<p>84 penny for milani.</p>
<p>I'm not quite high.</p>
<p>Vermilion or 2 pc more.</p>
<p>Two-piece attack.</p>
<p>So we're saying.</p>
<p>Very decent with prioritising what a.m. is it.</p>
<p>I have no you know what I never I never ever play animal characters so I never learnt the swirl thing I have no idea how to swirl what it does.</p>
<p>No attack so we're prioritising attack on shower.</p>
<p>Swirl or something I don't know.</p>
<p>I believe news him now.</p>
<p>9:00 a.m..</p>
<p>Yeah I mean this is well this is best artefacts for peace.</p>
<p>Is a four-piece fucked the police.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Why are four piece for the police what is 4 piece for the police do.</p>
<p>When turn hp increases or decreases crit rate will be increased by 12%.</p>
<p>I mean that's what i've got on my navigation.</p>
<p>At 10% on energy recharge.</p>
<p>Are two-piece.</p>
<p>Is that why.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But soon as soon it will be soon it will be and I can finally get my love you peace ok so let's see where the hell is very doesn't do a man.</p>

<p>And I studied at least I love.</p>
<p>It's like I don't know 20 and 20 two teams like 20 players or something.</p>
<p>And I would.</p>

<p>Bad.</p>
<p>19 dream solvents baby.</p>
<p>Two resin ready for that one five condensed although we might spend some of those getting some.</p>
<p>16 fragile.</p>
<p>I may be fragile.</p>
<p>But i'm not a resin.</p>
<p>That's all I know is there not a menu we can bring up to sure whether or is this very doesn't.</p>
<p>What is that.</p>
<p>Does age the heart does anybody know where very decent set is.</p>
<p>Where the hell is very decent.</p>

<p>Jesus lord christ ok race I found it I found it.</p>
<p>I shall.</p>
<p>I'm going to get you some artefacts.</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>How old is melting.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Let's do a condensed.</p>
<p>How do I do this utca + 8 business you know you could just look in the top left corner of the screen.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I didn't kill myself making this morning and as you recharge.</p>
<p>Play well that could be one piece maybe.</p>
<p>The anime.</p>
<p>In one piece.</p>
<p>How are you not still alive how.</p>
<p>Can we get another good peace.</p>
<p>Another good peace.</p>
<p>Hp son's messenger.</p>
<p>That would be sad.</p>
<p>I mean I did try trial shower and I think I used trial.</p>
<p>Somebody else and I failed miserably but.</p>
<p>I am somewhat apprehensive I don't mind giving him artefacts it's the levelling the.</p>
<p>What's up that's the problem.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>I might need fodder.</p>
<p>I eat ass.</p>
<p>I got no coins either.</p>
<p>The cabin crew.</p>
<p>Ok so I don't mind giving him some artefacts like that's fine I could just nick that is set up.</p>
<p>I was excited to get a hatsune miku look like.</p>
<p>This character for a while like they love this character inside I did try it but.</p>
<p>Enough for me.</p>
<p>Not my style what have you got to do 20.</p>
<p>How many we could what else have we got.</p>
<p>Attack with a lot of credit that's not a bad further we can give him that for now.</p>
<p>Have I got a decent flower why is bennett got on.</p>
<p>14.6 + 100.</p>
<p>Flat attack what is say you or whatever she's called wearing.</p>
<p>Does she go off defense.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Race race.</p>
<p>I see in the future.</p>
<p>Don't get too many modifications.</p>
<p>Tell cranium.</p>
<p>Installed animal damage.</p>
<p>Sucrose husband.</p>
<p>Energy recharge flat attack it's not the best.</p>
<p>Variety.</p>
<p>Green that's all.</p>
<p>Lots of hp.</p>
<p>What's are you wearing.</p>
<p>Hp so that's as good as it gets for now.</p>
<p>If I don't want to waste resources.</p>
<p>I really don't have one.</p>
<p>Hhp correct.</p>
<p>I failed you.</p>
<p>You know what i'm just going to give you an ass lynette with it's got 16.9% attack percent that is too bad 15.5 energy recharge.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>57.1 crit rate that's not bad what weapons you got.</p>
<p>Moon piercer.</p>
<p>Speak louder.</p>
<p>57.1% of my crit damage is rather rather shade.</p>
<p>Am I going to be honest to you guys.</p>
<p>The crit rate for crit damage because.</p>
<p>Is kind of art a work as me.</p>
<p>Is canada work I think it would be better off with chris damage.</p>
<p>Percent.</p>
<p>And I think you would turn his nose up with those earrings but I think he should be grateful.</p>
<p>I think you should be careful.</p>
<p>What's his right now.</p>
<p>26%.</p>
<p>Show.</p>
<p>Why you like this.</p>
<p>Has anybody got anything you can borrow.</p>
<p>Anybody.</p>
<p>Chris.</p>
<p>Well as long as you ask them nicely like that I think yeah I think that's why they wouldn't.</p>
<p>That's actually huge 21.6% attack percent.</p>
<p>5.4 more than what he had.</p>
<p>It's so complicated.</p>
<p>Win win.</p>
<p>The sweltering heat you know stink festival.</p>
<p>Apocalyptic landscape with me.</p>
<p>Falsely advertised it.</p>
<p>He also he's only level 80.</p>
<p>Equals to 90 disney.</p>
<p>I don't think this is worth my while.</p>
<p>If we go back to the imaginarium theatre.</p>
<p>Can we look at the.</p>
<p>It is mine.</p>
<p>But so what I did.</p>
<p>I don't know if anybody remembers this.</p>
<p>So at 1 point they said oh we're updating the teapot and the teapot was like out of action we couldn't.</p>
<p>Suffer months that it was under maintenance I collected these meze pieces.</p>
<p>And I mean i've got hundreds of these pieces and by the time it finally came back online I was like ok i'm going to build the biggest maze I could possibly can I wanted to be like in the shining.</p>
<p>But loadouts being increased.</p>
<p>Stop I think.</p>
<p>Going to be updating the maze in the next patch.</p>
<p>Because i'm hoping that they have increased the lord out on every single bit of land not just the bloody man one because last time they increased the increased loadout for the main house but they didn't increase it for this so yeah.</p>
<p>How to make this big annoy.</p>
<p>I already have.</p>
<p>Stop saying i'm not in my world shut up.</p>
<p>When tubby's world.</p>
<p>Where the hell am i.</p>
<p>How do I get to imaginarium theatre from here.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong.</p>
<p>So can I see this show.</p>
<p>Yes sounds identical.</p>

<p>Let's choose can you.</p>
<p>Can we go we go get a buff.</p>
<p>You wanted her who did you want.</p>
<p>Run shogun never got anything on again shirt.</p>
<p>Yes I think you had an unlucky experience.</p>
<p>Yes I was kind of hyped together because she was the only one I was missing.</p>
<p>One two or three.</p>
<p>Let's go with this.</p>
<p>I mean we can go for a good we can go for a great team to start us off but then what do we do once we start getting shit you know what I mean.</p>
<p>What's the seattle scores.</p>
<p>With plunge attacks but I don't know how you making plunge I saw him touch plunging down with him I don't have the fuck he was doing it.</p>
<p>Healing.</p>
<p>Some upwards gust from some other character to get the elevation out and on maybe it was a specific level.</p>
<p>I was supposed to ok should I reset.</p>
<p>Seattle scores what the hell.</p>
<p>Skip.</p>
<p>Start with her.</p>
<p>Drop one of them.</p>
<p>Yeah what the heck.</p>
<p>I did I killed an opponent with charged attacks I thought I did.</p>
<p>Oh my god is so annoying.</p>
<p>Do you like impossible I can't.</p>
<p>Because he just such a little fucking damage.</p>
<p>Ensure that one of them dies.</p>
<p>Does that count I mean that's again you charge attack that should count right let's just kill him with gunny's ball then.</p>
<p>Ok thank god next.</p>
<p>Choose an alternative cast member do I want.</p>
<p>Levels I mean.</p>
<p>Plus I feel like pyro could help me out at this point.</p>
<p>Do I have to click it again that seems weird I companion invite mystery cash we need to do that.</p>
<p>Selectable effects increased by one when choosing a mystery cat event I don't want that means.</p>
<p>Consume all the flowers in your position and one random alternate cast member jones the principal cast.</p>
<p>That sounds.</p>
<p>Loud texas game game elemental and physical damage bonus.</p>
<p>What does attack increases after receiving healing.</p>
<p>Can we pick one of these.</p>
<p>Screenshot.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Yeah ok.</p>
<p>Lego if I did that should count.</p>
<p>I don't know what a small reaction is.</p>
<p>What the fuck is this well reaction animal and war.</p>
<p>Genshin.</p>
<p>Swirl reaction.</p>
<p>I've got cryo animal on animal on a something that already has an element on it such as cryo well I cry and hydra why isn't it swallowing then I don't it should be swelling about itself shouldn't.</p>
<p>Swell your fuckers.</p>
<p>Play thank you all right next.</p>
<p>Are charlotte's or neelu.</p>
<p>Which got charlotte for now.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess 67% chance to obtain 90 fantasia flowers gone in.</p>
<p>Did I get them I don't even know whether I got them on companion invoice I think worry for now actually.</p>
<p>Bonus damage.</p>
<p>Ok so now I have to do the climatic battle.</p>
<p>This must be the one of the bosses then.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Yes I can't use any of those previous characters now.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>Bonus defeat the villain before it reconstructs a pearl of some kind.</p>
<p>I don't know when that is.</p>
<p>My cat is shit shit.</p>
<p>Can you sing off.</p>
<p>I wonder which element this character is I don't know.</p>
<p>How can I possibly know.</p>
<p>Insanely.</p>
<p>Cheesy.</p>
<p>Colours mean elements thing I don't know which is good.</p>
<p>Ok apparently I didn't get the time limit.</p>
<p>Crowd control.</p>
<p>What additional selectable events.</p>
<p>You are guaranteed to trigger support enhancement effects next two times you choose companion event.</p>
<p>Halloween 2016 90 fantasy falls you can buy isn't it I think.</p>
<p>Right now everything else is just the battle.</p>
<p>Siege win.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>I don't know how many more levels are left.</p>
<p>Let's go with I don't know.</p>
<p>Another one of these roberts.</p>
<p>Ok confirm selection.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I can do the same team again i.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But I save copy me for the letter levels.</p>
<p>Diana instead of.</p>
<p>Bring the robots to the knees whatever yeah.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>Why won't let me.</p>
<p>Switch.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>I got it in the eye.</p>
<p>Suck my dick.</p>
<p>What is awkward angle.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I feel characters hit mark opponents with attacks of the same elemental type a radiant blade descends on the dealing physical damage jesus christ it's like a peek of message.</p>
<p>Title shockwave that sounds good.</p>
<p>Do I have.</p>
<p>I don't really have any options.</p>
<p>How many levels there are.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>What am I going to do for the next.</p>
<p>The next levels though that's the problem.</p>
<p>What do I do after that that's the problem.</p>
<p>Most likely because i'm about to run out of time.</p>
<p>Can I go to three stars.</p>
<p>So i've got one more level which I can use that team for then I have three more levels after that and two of those of bosses.</p>
<p>Jesus winning a healer.</p>
<p>But we've got three levels and only one heel left.</p>
<p>How's it going to work.</p>
<p>I have no idea random companion we don't there's no more doesn't even anymore healers in the restaurant I mean.</p>
<p>Will die oh ok I think deanna can heal.</p>
<p>Diana for this one.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>Yeah we might need to survive so.</p>
<p>Free mystery cash.</p>
<p>Two chances to reroll selectable events gain one wondrous burn but after completing this combats event no more alternative cast members will join the principal cost one on the coasters with zero vega rejoined oh yeah.</p>
<p>And it's the one after that where we probably want to pick diana because that should be the easier level it's not a boss.</p>
<p>Are charlotte's gone that we can't use charlotte this time.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>I also called me doesn't go in that slot that will mess me up cooking me has to go in slot 3.</p>
<p>Play join your team regularly enough considering you need for.</p>
<p>For every two levels you know what I mean.</p>
<p>That's my biggest issue.</p>
<p>Maybe maybe I was supposed to invite my characters earlier on or something I don't know.</p>
<p>Performance failed what the hell.</p>
<p>Ok what am I misunderstanding from this.</p>
<p>I don't feel like that I should have been that far away from.</p>
<p>From being able to clear that.</p>
<p>Why you can't get me yeah grab.</p>
<p>Hit him.</p>
<p>Ok I want a lot better I just want the fuck out of it.</p>
<p>Jesus is not no chance.</p>
<p>Diana really.</p>
<p>I'm not a great player in the heater because I used to like I used to find egypt to trigger the reaction with a character with another dandruff character for that very reason I don't but man he doesn't know she's got tons of vm so she should be good maybe i'm playing the wrong I don't know.</p>
<p>Companion random I need companions that's what I need more than anything.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>I use rosary cos I don't really know how to play yolin and I don't think she's built properly either I don't my rosary is either to be honest ok let's go let's go for the dragon thing or whatever I think that'll be fine.</p>
<p>A lot of he was made pretty much redundant by higher because most of the new enemies alike too heavy for him.</p>
<p>She lost for no reason.</p>
<p>Is there any only really like about 20%.</p>
<p>Are you ever going to get your fucking alt back over.</p>
<p>Got two stars.</p>
<p>Do I need any more companions.</p>
<p>What is the final level ok we just got one level ok that's fine I guess this is the final level.</p>
<p>So yeah this is actually isn't too bad this time.</p>
<p>100%.</p>
<p>I wonder if changelings gonna be better than one of those but which one.</p>
<p>Well we can change if we feel it I think we can restart it and just try different characters I think that's it lets you do that so we'll try to see how it goes.</p>
<p>I need a boy i've got a boy user.</p>
<p>Cedron I love you.</p>
<p>Yes I would have been fucked without you here.</p>
<p>You literally need a boy user for this.</p>
<p>Jesus christ it just feels like all the skills are constantly on cooldown you can't do shit with them.</p>
<p>A lot of this game is annoying when a character skills available which and how those skills rotate with other team members so this game mode is fucking hell for me because like I would never use these characters together.</p>
<p>And so I don't know when the fucking skills are coming on.</p>
<p>Yeah so like once you once you get used to a team like you know how the the skills rotate against each other yeah look at my time there's no fucking way i'm doing this.</p>
<p>I feel like I could only do this final level if I was allowed to use a team that i'm familiar with.</p>
<p>What is that I was left over with that i'm now being asked to do the impossible with I don't know I just like fuck off like how how does anybody like this I think this is fucking torture.</p>
<p>What was next to fucking useless let's try swap when I was rosario rosario.</p>
<p>Sounds like you need to shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Do something somebody.</p>
<p>Don't tell me the countdown seasons.</p>
<p>Nobody does any damage like what the fuck is.</p>
<p>Are you seeing this like 100 fucking damage each like what.</p>
<p>But this team is not really meant to fucking work together.</p>
<p>This is like this I genuinely feel like this is impossible.</p>
<p>With with what i'm left with.</p>
<p>Oh my god when you fucking calm down you gotta wait for it to rotate or ward you great so not only on this like tight ass time limit you also have to deal with these bullshit gimmicky mechanics where the fucking robot will hide its wings from you for like.</p>
<p>This fucking team is absolute auto trash.</p>
<p>What the fuck is this.</p>
<p>Yeah I can't even get it I can't even do half of what I need to do to it.</p>
<p>Time not even half.</p>
<p>How many minutes to do that.</p>
<p>I don't know how I meant to do that.</p>
<p>And they need fucking bloom teams to react off of really.</p>
<p>I mean look the community centre fucking cock me was trash when she came out she was never trash.</p>
<p>Spell characters.</p>
<p>And it's just frustrating cuz like it just feels like none of them ever do any fucking damage.</p>
<p>So I don't know really what I meant to do to be honest.</p>
<p>I will fuck a super hard.</p>
<p>Everybody else.</p>
<p>It's me bitch oh well weirdly that made him come down I don't even know why I just know that i'm normally you have to do the full thing right both wings.</p>
<p>Somebody do something.</p>
<p>Yeah maybe my shangli is not built you know I probably took a gear offer.</p>
<p>Do something.</p>
<p>Yeah I can't I can barely even get it passed less than half it's half.</p>
<p>Every combination of characters I can think of.</p>
<p>And it makes sense to me that I can't do it because like I said right this whole game is about knowing when to bring everybody's e skill I guess the only way I could do this is.</p>
<p>Bring the I don't know I can't I don't even know how to play most of these characters also am I allowed to leave and come back.</p>
<p>I just want to check to see whether my are you can.</p>
<p>Can you dress your characters.</p>
<p>Thought you could do that.</p>
<p>Character preview.</p>
<p>Right does my chiang ling have anything.</p>
<p>Volume jade wing.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to leave and come back continue performance restart pause performance.</p>
<p>So let's go to my channel name.</p>
<p>Eyebrows.</p>
<p>Where's shanling.</p>
<p>Oh yeah I didn't even notice.</p>
<p>I didn't even know.</p>
<p>Play ride damage bonus ok.</p>
<p>Spell did we have in that team.</p>
<p>Who else did I have.</p>
<p>Melanie's kind of got some rosario I think my rosary is probably not got any gear on her.</p>
<p>Where the fuck is gun you.</p>
<p>Why am I seeing my can you.</p>
<p>Right ok can you.</p>
<p>What's a flower well whatever gun use not wearing rosario's got it I just remember.</p>
<p>Where's my fucking daniella.</p>
<p>Physical damage bonus.</p>
<p>Rosario is mostly physical.</p>
<p>Remove that and we'll give her gun use cryo damage bonus.</p>
<p>At level 20 ok so any slots that can you is missing needs to come back off rosario.</p>
<p>Continue combat cool.</p>
<p>What team did we have.</p>
<p>That should be tried I don't even know if that is trial.</p>
<p>Is that trial dear or is it mine.</p>
<p>No wonder I can't do it.</p>
<p>I use my dear will die my day is not built.</p>
<p>Well I mean yeah like I said I don't play these freaking.</p>
<p>Do you remember all this as well.</p>
<p>How was andreas is going to take please.</p>
<p>And play definitely needs this back.</p>
<p>Are user and spiral vs every single.</p>
<p>Every single season or whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>Yeah now.</p>
<p>Can we take we got chiang ling that that should be a fully built team I also tried rosario but I don't know whether we want to do rosario or not.</p>
<p>Let's just try this.</p>
<p>Cast.</p>
<p>Stop piss off.</p>
<p>Should I actually play.</p>
<p>I just do not I do not fucking understand how the fucking I meant to do this.</p>
<p>How are you meant to do this.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Do you do anything rosario ever.</p>
<p>Do you actually do anything ever.</p>
<p>I feel like you don't.</p>
<p>Frozen you haven't frozen it once fucking yet and then shit.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing that annoys me so much in video games when everything is easy until the very last level when you get the reward and then I like haha.</p>
<p>Fuck you like the different curve now is just like actually insane and it's like fuck off.</p>
<p>It's like.</p>
<p>It didn't feel like it was like.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Do you want do you want me to kick in the fucking balls shut up I was playing on well kick you in the fucking time on right fuck this i'm so done with this I thought I hate this game mode and I 100% do i'll go to pause in case I ever want to come back but like fuck that man.</p>
<p>It's not even like it's it doesn't seem even like like I wouldn't mind if I was like oh I was within 5% or something you.</p>
<p>When like either you know you made a mistake.</p>
<p>And I need to squeeze a bit more.</p>
<p>That to me is good that's good engaging gameplay but this when it's like.</p>
<p>Best gear.</p>
<p>Lemons.</p>
<p>Who's got cleese.</p>
<p>I know it did it actually did but I think it's because I was like I was getting very friendly before I did the gears change and I was just like mashing buttons as fast as I could.</p>
<p>Put.</p>
<p>Who did I give please.</p>
<p>I was a deer.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I don't know I think because I did the second and I think I gave.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that's what I did.</p>
<p>Play had two piece glad you that might be right actually.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even mind it so much like I said if it just felt reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Play probably has a better idea of how some of these characters work but I think the average player is probably more like me you play favourite characters and an outside of that you just don't give a fuck.</p>
<p>Search I think it's weird especially invention which is such a casual game.</p>
<p>I think it's so weird to be like fuck you play you will learn how to play these characters.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I think genshin is the last game that once again more like this.</p>
<p>Write like why this for the endgame it's just bizarre me it's just insane.</p>
<p>Yeah whatever not for me definitely not for me.</p>
<p>Bus to doable either.</p>
<p>The only way I can think of that I can do this game mode is if i'm able to get really lucky and save like some ultimate team for the end because the rest of it was easy and this is the other thing that knows me about stuff like this when hey level one easy level 99 easy level 100.</p>
<p>And it's like.</p>
<p>Wow you just wasted my time for all those levels that were easy and weren't a challenge at all and then suddenly it's like impossible.</p>
<p>It's shit it's stupid.</p>
<p>Will not just a good unit.</p>
<p>But the problem with this season is if we look at if we look at who's in there let me see it again I would have to start a new one would like to see it.</p>
<p>Rewind remaining one you're only allowed to rewind remaining.</p>
<p>And if I get fuck off a lot ok I got something for her what did I get.</p>
<p>60 premiums do I get anything else.</p>
<p>I did all out for 63 millions.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Right so let's see let's see what it gave me the options of right so these are my initial options then when I got a next.</p>
<p>I get to pick from these other ones now everything you know everything passed rosario here isn't even fucking close to build.</p>
<p>And some of these are not even built.</p>
<p>Something I think.</p>
<p>Yeah so he's the problem with that I guess even if I could now of course it's random who gets brought in as well but I guess if you can try and bring them in and save them and keep them till the end i'm just looking at this and thinking well what team do I think might even out of this loss might even be able to clear that will I need a boy user so can you would can you could probably fucking do 90% of it on her own and be honest.</p>
<p>Play daniel to do that.</p>
<p>Can you call me for the final fight and then I don't even think it matters is whether if you.</p>
<p>And neil is good but she's neil is very specific.</p>
<p>If you go for a bloom team.</p>
<p>You still need welfare that I don't know whether I pick that boss did I pick that boss cos for that boss you need a boy user to shoot it down.</p>
<p>Isn't good for reactions.</p>
<p>What do you do.</p>
<p>You either take someone like venti.</p>
<p>I don't even know what a good I don't even see a good team here for me at least I don't even really see a good team here for doing any of that.</p>
<p>But I guess if the boss wasn't if it was if I picked up boss I said he primary antagonist so these the final bosses.</p>
<p>No that's the villain from act 3 that's the villain from act 6 and yeah he is the boss oh my god that's so in sent to me.</p>
<p>I might watch n touch to see how he did that final level because i'm curious.</p>
<p>But the problem I see here.</p>
<p>Is that the only.</p>
<p>The only boy uses you can pick.</p>
<p>And I don't really see any amazing teams you could build with us characters.</p>
<p>To do that final boss.</p>
<p>You might not need a healer for that final boss I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yes yeah it's very gimmicky it's very gimmicky.</p>
<p>Why the hell would I want any of these pauses.</p>
<p>There isn't even a single.</p>
<p>Character here that I would want to learn pauses for.</p>
<p>Yeah it's it's i'm not a fan of that boss it's very gimmicky.</p>
<p>Is is quite annoying.</p>
<p>Is quite annoying.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>This is the echo thing two or four.</p>
<p>Sea green particle effects of.</p>
<p>I'm used to that meaning that she's applying dendra.</p>
<p>But when you turn a record on which is like just to make a look pretty or whatever she's always leaving these green particle effects and that confuses my bread and I keep thinking wet am I playing dendra but i'm not cos it's just the so I actually switched it off so I learnt it for carrara but i've switched it off because it just confuses me too much.</p>
<p>I will be back.</p>
<p>Am I am I come on a little later.</p>
<p>9 hours 10 hours away then isn't that.</p>
<p>Do anything for joining me catch you later.</p>
<p>Thanks jean that almost looks like a redemption card.</p>
<p>Desperately trying last minute redemption chords I get nothing everybody else gets an extra 5% chance winning.</p>
<p>What do I get.</p>
<p>I get jean.</p>
<p>I got jean thanks jean.</p>
<p>Bitch.</p>
<p>Freaking gino.</p>

<p>Cool have you got the like the ultimate official good like the good good best ending yet.</p>
<p>We only have our gene.</p>
<p>Milani.</p>
<p>Hi let's do it.</p>
<p>Super bosses that are above level 100.</p>
<p>Ok we got one back.</p>
<p>We got one back.</p>
<p>Come on milani.</p>
<p>Stop pissing me around milani come on.</p>
<p>Wow this girl hates me.</p>
<p>This girl actually hates me.</p>
<p>Ok we got two bucket list.</p>
<p>Melanie why do you hate me so much.</p>
<p>Usually.</p>
<p>Oh my god what is it with this girl.</p>
<p>Do you not know who I am moana.</p>
<p>Lock part of the patch notes probably says cappys drop rate has been set to 0%.</p>
<p>Do you ever happened to me once in a star rail.</p>
<p>Rerun account not even the star rail account that actually play I was doing rerolls on star rail when it first came out and I had to do it few times and in one of my 10 poles I literally got back to back to 5 stars.</p>
<p>It's never happened before.</p>
<p>Come on milani i'm tired of this now.</p>
<p>Oh my god she hates me why do you hate me so much.</p>
<p>We got another cucina at least.</p>
<p>Milani why do you hate me so much.</p>
<p>I cannot believe this.</p>
<p>Cannot believe this these might be the worst pills i've ever had in the game ever.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Turn the kitchen.</p>
<p>This is actually ridiculous.</p>
<p>Oh my god will you just show up what is this.</p>
<p>Do I even have another temple.</p>
<p>I feel like she is I don't even know how many that is.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>It has to be this one it has to be this one.</p>
<p>At last.</p>
<p>Oh my god last ok can we get two.</p>
<p>Can we get back to back.</p>
<p>Can we get two.</p>
<p>Suffering.</p>
<p>Weapons and bennetts that's all in jeans this is the weapons bennett and jean banner for me.</p>
<p>Are weapons better and jean banner.</p>
<p>Yep that's exactly what this is finally.</p>
<p>Took you long enough.</p>
<p>Yeah can you.</p>
<p>Show up next time.</p>
<p>Hop on.</p>
<p>Hop on she said.</p>
<p>Left over.</p>
<p>Play beautiful what these I think these genuinely might be the worst paul's from any gacha game i've ever done.</p>
<p>What does that do she's got 15 extra levels on on turbo twirly and she gets when cucina uses time to get serious she will again.</p>
<p>Where was icing was I calling melanie cucina.</p>
<p>So if I do milanese character quest now I can level her up can i.</p>
<p>And I can I can feel safe doing a trial now.</p>
<p>It's not cute.</p>
<p>You made me spend money a lot of money.</p>
<p>I wasn't playing on spending.</p>
<p>But the thing is right it didn't matter.</p>
<p>It didn't matter.</p>
<p>Will you shut up it didn't matter for fontaine because there was no way who's in front hand right so there was nobody that I needed for fontaines release for.</p>
<p>Boys for months.</p>
<p>And then the patch before that was samaru well I was taking a break from genshin went to america outside didn't care then and sam gosford and a zoomer the one before that I was taking a break when it was only came outside I didn't care then and obviously the ones before that was when the game first came out so this feels like the only patch that I really wanted to get the new character for the new content so I can play them together.</p>
<p>No I still it's too soon.</p>
<p>I'd rather have moody little cucina on my profile I don't want your face on my profile.</p>
<p>Niche.</p>
<p>Anyone who's playing jean and really loves jean is just a gene sim in my mind but there's just for whatever reason they're just in love with je.</p>
<p>It's like but I feel the same way about bennett but a lot of people like bennett where the hell is this new girl.</p>
<p>Where is what where is she.</p>
<p>The bottom you're replacing.</p>

<p>Can you do something melanie.</p>
<p>My the time I felt kind of like if I don't swipe I don't get the character was cooking me.</p>
<p>Uninstall.</p>
<p>Can we get to keep the money awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Make sure you come back next patch.</p>
<p>Stands more of a chance to than milani.</p>
<p>I thank god i've got the world's strongest siege win she's probably not the world's strongest season but she's she's pretty nice.</p>
<p>Let's get organised.</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>Sounds like our shark.</p>
<p>I was shocked you do americans do say shark instead of shark it's true.</p>
<p>Where's we would say shark.</p>
<p>You see what i'm saying.</p>
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<p>Shocked.</p>
<p>Believe me.</p>
<p>Alright so let's see how do we get mats I tried looking for cuc.</p>
<p>Didn't find how to get to the boss.</p>
<p>Some maths to do her first as.</p>
<p>Wait so it is he going to get an old school trial in a doorman are they going to like stick him in the middle of in a zoom or something.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>No he gets the old he gets the old mouldy dungeon yeah that's what you deserve by.</p>
<p>I'm getting flush bucks from yesterday's imaginarium theatre.</p>
<p>I can't believe I launch you.</p>
<p>Who tell gear.</p>
<p>Anymore.</p>
<p>Continue challenge or exit stage you want to exit the stage yeah the good the good thing about the old moldy domains as you can clear them very quickly.</p>
<p>That took me what like 20 seconds 20 seconds and I get 20 premise.</p>
<p>The bad news about these new these new domains which are really weird to put you in the world.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert right.</p>
<p>Is the tick a month to complete.</p>
<p>Ok that's flushy.</p>
<p>Control by comparison.</p>
<p>You can tag him.</p>
<p>What's the e skill to all the eskil does.</p>
<p>What kind of weird.</p>
<p>Ok so you can attack on the surfboard.</p>
<p>A pink ball at it.</p>
<p>Ok that's weird.</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>Very different these new characters.</p>
<p>Which is kinda good I guess.</p>
<p>Because a resale just gets her on and off the surfboard you know what I mean so I suppose you're a skill is.</p>
<p>Run them over on the surfboard maybe.</p>
<p>It feels weird.</p>
<p>Dropkick and she puts a shield at the same time so she'll attack the enemy can I activate my surfboard in the water.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>So you've got to be on land to activate the surfboard.</p>
<p>And I think that's just does that just give an attack buff what is the marking do exactly.</p>
<p>Are you going to attack them on the surfboard which does do quite a lot of damage actually.</p>
<p>What are quite a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Chance complete you can you can leave a.</p>
<p>So what if I mark them and then do my alt does that do anything different.</p>
<p>How to tell cos I was stood up stood in the middle of them anyway.</p>
<p>Random bollocks did she say random bullocks I swear she said random bollocks.</p>
<p>Random voice she's no way she said that.</p>
<p>Are the enemies set at.</p>
<p>Random bullocks.</p>
<p>Exit level.</p>
<p>You can come back to life.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well hope it goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Having a smoothie.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Milani.</p>
<p>Isaac.</p>
<p>Ok so we healed milani we can claim her first ascension marks I think.</p>
<p>Yeah that's that.</p>
<p>Yeah you might need you might need it.</p>
<p>But then of course they're not just.</p>
<p>Unless you just getting a check up they're not just in your mouth are they if you were getting work done like that.</p>
<p>Productive in your mouth where is where does the way I say this sound so bad.</p>
<p>You know what I mean.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make the sound so sick.</p>
<p>Family from mint gun.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Argon.</p>
<p>When was the last time I had to.</p>
<p>Fire to cook here.</p>
<p>So I must have accidentally.</p>
<p>What was all I can think is that it's normally late.</p>
<p>And I must have accidentally put it out clear we need you.</p>
<p>All right now we've got a fire.</p>
<p>Do we have new things to cook yes we do we got to do 20 doors for all battle pass.</p>
<p>Diana.</p>
<p>Not jean you know what jean.</p>
<p>Yeah get cooking get cooking.</p>
<p>Oh good.</p>
<p>No no i'm delete.</p>
<p>I am going to I am going to detect when that joke comes through and i'm going to make it say something insane.</p>
<p>I'm so sick of that joke that joke is like.</p>
<p>Is stalking me.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>It's like gpt favourite joke.</p>
<p>6000 times.</p>
<p>Bless them bless the little sucks so annoying.</p>
<p>That's what it's like a little kid.</p>
<p>What's your favourite joke i'm going to tell you 10 times.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I gave it the worst part is I gave it a joke book with thousands of jokes literally what you saw you know this it has but like I said those I think those are coming through the language model itself that's why.</p>
<p>My joke book.</p>
<p>Jokes let's find a joke.</p>
<p>Delete it.</p>
<p>Scarecrow.</p>
<p>Is it how many times is it in.</p>
<p>Why is it in my joke oh my god look at it.</p>
<p>Why is this joke in my joke look like thousands of times 1000 times.</p>
<p>So it's at 192.</p>
<p>It's at 192.</p>
<p>618.</p>
<p>It's like well it's like adding 5% to the 50 50 banner you have a higher chance.</p>
<p>There are 935.</p>
<p>3 or 4 copies of that joke that's still only like 3 in 1000 chance of saying that jokes specifically.</p>
<p>If he says if he says it now it's 100% coming from the language model.</p>
<p>Ok i'm so sick of that joke.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>Ok I barely made that perfect.</p>
<p>Kit angry.</p>
<p>Kids hungry why you angry.</p>
<p>My angry bird.</p>
<p>Yeah they don't make sense being cut tonight will I thought it was called ai angry because they're it says I angry.</p>
<p>What expired.</p>
<p>A bunch of stuff expired.</p>
<p>I don't know why what is this.</p>
<p>Reaffirm the card appellation so this is a way to rename.</p>
<p>Marcus if I want.</p>
<p>Wanderers well right I called what did I call wanda a stinky I called wanderers stinky so that once if I want to rename wanderer.</p>
<p>But I like stinky.</p>
<p>And that's if I want to rename marcus but I quite like marcus so that's fine.</p>
<p>Alright so I think I did.</p>
<p>40 now.</p>
<p>I want to make her stronger.</p>
<p>Levelled up sooner rather than later I wouldn't.</p>
<p>Can i.</p>
<p>I will I didn't last very long.</p>
<p>Shut up really quickly.</p>
<p>I'll be honest farina was better like so I don't I don't think I can go like she's a surf girl and look this is as far as I can get by default.</p>
<p>So the thing with farina is you can pop the skill.</p>
<p>And then you start to see a cool down.</p>
<p>Now here it says there is no cool down so you can pop it again but i'm guessing if I pop it again yeah she just she just gets.</p>
<p>I can't believe I spent so much money on you.</p>
<p>I think she's actually a little disappointing.</p>
<p>Will it be wrong maybe I need to get this flood just in thing.</p>
<p>Works in a similar way.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't have a flood system bar now but then.</p>
<p>I think the only way to get one is to pick up those red orbs specifically in that one so they're not just make them kind of shit outside of nutland do you mean like yeah ok they'll be good in that one but.</p>
<p>That's very limited like farina will walk on water anywhere in the fucking world like she doesn't need to be in fucking fontaine to do.</p>
<p>It looks like these guys.</p>
<p>Otherwise they just did the skills run out too quickly.</p>
<p>I suppose I suppose cucina is replacing.</p>
<p>Kirara sushi.</p>
<p>Better than carrara because carrara had the same limitations but the reason milani feels worse.</p>
<p>It's because.</p>
<p>Marina can walk on water infinitely because she has such a shot cool down on a eskill.</p>
<p>Where is milani has to be in matalan.</p>
<p>To get any to get any distance like so if I want to use let's get on the surfboard now and like how far we can get a better can't even get to that.</p>
<p>I stopped here.</p>
<p>I assume is that the island.</p>
<p>2/3 of the way there right.</p>
<p>And I obviously you know there's no getting to win a zoomer with melanie that's one thing for sure.</p>
<p>I mean whatever it is what it is right.</p>
<p>Yeah I i will say that like she.</p>
<p>Downgrade swapping my.</p>
<p>Dinner for milani is certainly in terms of like.</p>
<p>Personal environmental you know.</p>
<p>And it's it's starting to feel like she's only going to be somewhat useful in that land.</p>
<p>Disappointing.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Ok let me do a test I want to figure something out I mean it's not really.</p>
<p>It doesn't solve the problem anywhere.</p>
<p>What the hell is this.</p>
<p>In dwell a tabular thesaurus.</p>
<p>Quickly.</p>
<p>Will I need to find some of this lodges and stuff red red orbs is that what I want to know is if I charge my flight distance charged it's that red bar.</p>
<p>Is that red bar above my health bar I think.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>If I if I go out of nutland.</p>
<p>Is the charging my flight is done.</p>
<p>Do I keep the fluorescent jeremy can I use it can I at least used it once no you lose it the bar is gone now.</p>
<p>Yeah I also think that's actually a bit shit if i'm being honest.</p>
<p>She runs out before I specifically want to find out if it diss.</p>
<p>As I leave natalan.</p>
<p>What will happen.</p>
<p>As curious how it works to be honest.</p>
<p>She won't burn that flood just in now because she'll she'll use her own energy first once she.</p>
<p>But it doesn't work like farinas like you can't.</p>
<p>You can't activate it when on the water at all.</p>
<p>Shit I use.</p>
<p>On and off as you enter and exit that one it looks like.</p>
<p>Texture problems.</p>
<p>Oh wow.</p>
<p>Soul soul shared a change.</p>
<p>How many shame because she's fun that's what I mean right the traversals really fun.</p>
<p>Limits you know.</p>
<p>Pretty much matches carrara.</p>
<p>So she's fine but like I said milani feels like a step backwards to me.</p>
<p>Is a traversal because.</p>
<p>Play comparison is so much more restrictive.</p>
<p>They won't let you activate the surfboard on the water.</p>
<p>The warehouse skill works.</p>
<p>You can't reactivate it when the cooldown ends because it doesn't work like that you basically switch it on or off and if it times out while it's on that's it you've lost it and you can't react to it in the water so it feels like it feels like we're going backwards to me like just give us more stop taking.</p>
<p>Like you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Freedom.</p>
<p>Put milani feels like you know we're going backwards again.</p>
<p>I owe you can't you can't activate the surfboard in the water on when the when the skills gone it's gone so what's the point I mean she's the whole thing is she's a surfer girl but she can go like 10 m in the water and that's it she's done.</p>
<p>Yeah I genuinely genuinely disappointed with a surfing.</p>
<p>What's a fontaines.</p>
<p>And farina can do it so it's not like.</p>
<p>It's not like they haven't done it with other characters so why have they made her surfing so restrictive.</p>
<p>Ok that that is going to be my biggest feedback on the next bloody feedback farm to be honest.</p>
<p>The next feedback form i'm going to put in block capitals.</p>
<p>What the hell can melanie only serve 10 m.</p>
<p>She's a surf girl.</p>
<p>Just letters a user for fucksake.</p>
<p>I just I just don't get it.</p>
<p>Why are we going back over.</p>
<p>Let's ride for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>God forbid you should have fun.</p>
<p>$100 character.</p>
<p>Surf shop run out of time.</p>
<p>Give us another $100 and we might let you stay on for another 2 seconds.</p>
<p>I just don't know why we're going backwards.</p>
<p>Why are we going back over.</p>
<p>Ok let's see so we need to.</p>
<p>Next I guess.</p>
<p>Teleport as fast.</p>
<p>Does she has to be more powerful than you know some random surfer girl but.</p>
<p>A whole thing is that she serves.</p>
<p>That's a hole does a whole gimmick.</p>
<p>At least like I wouldn't even mind if it was a like if it was a reasonable amount of time to give you like 2 minutes or 3 minutes on the surfboard before it kicks you off you know something like that you can actually do a lot with.</p>
<p>I mean how long is this time at 1.</p>
<p>Call 5.</p>
<p>At 5 seconds and then it starts burning flushes and which you can't do anywhere other than that one.</p>
<p>5 seconds you get.</p>
<p>G.</p>
<p>5 seconds.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Transitioning between different.</p>
<p>Different modes or whatever.</p>
<p>Where's the.</p>
<p>I thought I saw it though.</p>
<p>What what is this.</p>
<p>Yeah and so we felt like that this was this was one thing that I always thought tara fantasy was better.</p>
<p>I'll be honest.</p>
<p>I thought tara fantasy had genshin beat in one place and that was with it's like but then that's hilarious right.</p>
<p>Infinite jetpack one show upgraded at once no stamina it was great get yourself better on the water like that they let you actually get around in that game without being like it being ridiculous to punishing or whatever.</p>
<p>And I thought it made it so much better.</p>
<p>The mechanics were better let's get this real it's not like exploration was better until fantasy because you know.</p>
<p>What you were exploring was now.</p>
<p>Does quality but.</p>
<p>In terms of the mechanics to get you from out to be though I thought we're actually better in time for that.</p>
<p>Did they give you extra things like surfboards.</p>
<p>And they were very unrestricted with her.</p>
<p>Wow well done the one thing you had that was better than.</p>
<p>Is that the dude character over there.</p>
<p>With little dragon.</p>
<p>I come down now.</p>
<p>This is fun as well like katina is really fun.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know if so far melanie feels a little disappointing to me.</p>
<p>5 seconds.</p>
<p>Newer characters.</p>
<p>Ok so that was a chest then.</p>
<p>Also what wings do I want to give you.</p>
<p>I didn't reset expedition reward I didn't reset my expedition.</p>
<p>Have I got distracted.</p>
<p>Yeah they look right.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>Yeah they look good.</p>
<p>Ok so i'm heading i'm still trying to get to this.</p>
<p>27.</p>
<p>Stop stop.</p>
<p>So the statue is above me.</p>
<p>I need to check to see it doesn't say daily commission rewards it just says expedition rewards I must have gotten my commission rewards but not recent expeditions.</p>
<p>Tell me that's nothing it's not in the world.</p>
<p>Right so I need to do.</p>
<p>I think I need to do her quest.</p>
<p>Unlocked after unlocking nutland tribe reputation which we haven't unlocked yet right prerequisite.</p>
<p>Quest chapter 5 act 1 so we need to do some of the archon quest first.</p>
<p>Yeah and I don't like that's the thing right now that they're doing that see that feels a bit weird as well right it's like oh ok.</p>
<p>You're a mad lad who went and got the character on day one imagine that's always been a problem in this game.</p>
<p>It's always like I remember watching.</p>
<p>A youtuber get aiko when she first came out.</p>
<p>And inazuma just.</p>
<p>And so he's like running through.</p>
<p>Experience.</p>
<p>So he's why.</p>
<p>Here's why I think this sucks right they could have they could have sold that and I thought that's what they've done so when they announced that you can do the character quest and you get to level them up to 60 and you don't have to stress about mats I thought oh ok so they recognise that that's a problem in a new area and now you can you know chill and enjoy the new content without having to stress out about it.</p>
<p>First then I have to unlock reputation first and then I have to do her character quest in order to get these maths so it's like well.</p>
<p>Could have just given me them.</p>
<p>Play elizabeth shit to me as well.</p>
<p>Ok you must first do this and this and this and it's like well sam still you haven't solved the problem then.</p>
<p>Why do me now just feels like I don't know which ones.</p>
<p>I don't want to be rushed I don't want to be rushed through the ark on quest.</p>
<p>Get to reputation just so that I can level my character and start playing my character.</p>
<p>Add probably rather do it the old way and just fucking go and find the months to be honest.</p>
<p>So where I where I thought did solve the problem they're just created a new one.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>What would have been so bad about just letting me do melanie's quest right now the second fontana comes out and then go and then get her character mats for and then level up or open play like what why do I have to complete these other things first it just doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>Unless there's like some story progression and they're worried about like the story getting messed up as a.</p>
<p>In which case I don't know well maybe don't offer that as a solution then.</p>
<p>So now i'm genuinely lost and confused about what I should do.</p>
<p>Do I want to be rushed through the freaking ark on quest.</p>
<p>Shut up shut up shut up shut up.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Stop old problem.</p>
<p>New regent comes out.</p>
<p>You have nomads.</p>
<p>Don't know where they are you need to go find them.</p>
<p>So the old problem is you're running around like a headless chicken.</p>
<p>Spoiler in the new region essentially because you need these mats before you can enjoy your brand new character.</p>
<p>And it can be quite stressful and you know and and troublesome feet to do that in an unknown area.</p>
<p>Solution let's give the player.</p>
<p>How much do you need to level up to level 60.</p>
<p>But let's lock it behind story progression and reputation unlocking and the character quest.</p>
<p>What's 3 huge parts of the content that I need to complete.</p>
<p>So like now i'm in a weird predicament as a player because i'm like well.</p>
<p>I might not be ready to do those things yet like I don't necessarily know if I am I don't know if I want to do them right now I don't want to feel like bullied into like you know speed running through the character quest.</p>
<p>Reputation just so that I can level my new character up and start using her.</p>
<p>I'd rather at the moment I feel like.</p>
<p>How to do it the old way.</p>
<p>I'd rather just run around like headless chicken.</p>
<p>Matt's and take my time doing that.</p>
<p>Because now it.</p>
<p>Imagine if all you care about is playing the new character which a lot of people are.</p>
<p>You've been hate for this new character whatever new regent.</p>
<p>A lot of players are literally just going to speed run all of that new regions can't.</p>
<p>Which essentially just spoils it for them.</p>
<p>And all of this could be avoided if they just gave you the fucking mats.</p>
<p>I'll just give you access to the character story at least.</p>
<p>Congratulations you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Trading some commission points or whatever whatever it might be right trade in some login points.</p>
<p>I don't know why they had a locket behind three huge.</p>
<p>Three huge you know parts of the new content update.</p>
<p>Because that's that makes the problem of spoiling the content which is what I think it does.</p>
<p>He's the solution don't introduce regional maths for new characters until the new regions been out for like.</p>
<p>At least a couple of banner cycles so make it so the first couple of characters for a new regent don't just use different mats from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Might not make sense.</p>
<p>And that's probably why they don't do it but it's sure is a much better fucking player experience than running around like a headless chicken not being able to and then then players like real dedicated players right and sweaty try hards like me complete the other advantage of that as well is like you can pray farm for the upcoming character if you know you're getting milani you know she's going to use fontaine water stuff right.</p>
<p>Yeah make make make make the first couple of banner characters.</p>
<p>Hey I live in I live in matalan but i'm from fontaine.</p>
<p>If you really worried about the law just make it so the first couple of characters that you meet in a region move from the region you just came from or whatever you know what I mean you can work it out that way please can still prefer mats for upcoming characters so by the time the character comes out they're already to go.</p>
<p>It means even place who are returning to the game specifically file that character aren't spoiling the new region while trying to farm those months that wouldn't around in the old regent instead so they're not really spoiling anything unless they're really really behind.</p>
<p>Character quest and unlock reputation before we'll let you level your melania.</p>
<p>Because that's just going to make me feel now like I have to do that as quickly as possible to actually start playing my new character so now i'm not like enjoying.</p>
<p>Is the same for gameplay right if you if you feel like pressure to you've got to do this and this and this in order to you know reach your big goal.</p>
<p>I think it's just like it's like a linear thing it's like how linear is the game.</p>
<p>Can I think it's still too linear.</p>
<p>Restrictive.</p>
<p>And that's something else I think they need to work and I think they should just fucking chill the fuck out and let players do what they want when they want to do it especially in this game this is a casual like you know anime game like it's about casual does it get jesus some of the events are about petting cats like you don't have to take things so seriously it's a fucking casual game for casual people.</p>
<p>It'll be fine just let players get.</p>
<p>So yeah i'm.</p>
<p>My biggest tooth disappointment so far aside from losing the 50/50.</p>
<p>Is that melanie's melanie's skill.</p>
<p>Last 5 seconds.</p>
<p>And then it's over.</p>
<p>Does nowhere to activate it while in the.</p>
<p>Useless as a surfer girl.</p>
<p>Are wow she's a surfer girl for 5 seconds of the day.</p>
<p>Especially when you when it's she's replacing my she's replacing my.</p>
<p>Farina.</p>
<p>Farina can walk for everyone water the only justification I can think of for is oh but farina and icon so you know you can't have a surfer girl like who's you know just as strong as she is i'm not asking for it to be just as strong but she is a surfer girl.</p>
<p>I don't understand the obsession with stamina metres and stuff like that right why the fuck at world level 56 that we can now get to write are we still dealing with stamina bars when gliding.</p>
<p>Just stop it already.</p>
<p>What is enough height to glide down now just let us fucking glide.</p>
<p>Why does the boat why does the wave rider have a stamina bar.</p>
<p>Is a boat but don't have stamina it it makes zero sense but this game is obsession with like.</p>
<p>2024.</p>
<p>Get rid of the freaking stamina bars.</p>
<p>At least at least once you hit a certain end game right.</p>
<p>Chill the fuck out let melanie surf.</p>
<p>And maybe if the the only other the only other reason I can think of for doing it this way is maybe they think should be too strong cuz her attack seem to be more powerful when she's on the surfboard so if they're like ah but then you know her attacks.</p>
<p>Make a too strong or whatever for.</p>
<p>Well then you should have thought about that and separated does two things out right you make the surfboard functionality separate from the powerful attack functionality and then you put the restrictive cooldown on the attack buff functionality not on the surfboard.</p>
<p>The surfboard should be on and off at will whenever you want.</p>
<p>Call stamina.</p>
<p>No restrictions activated in or out of the water because she's a surfer girl.</p>
<p>It doesn't it doesn't make a stronger power creep for you anywhere it just it matches it makes or even it means that now you can use the fun new character in place of arena to surf around on the water rather than walk across it so it feels like an actual upgrade but right now milani feels like a downgrade because you can she gets 5 seconds and then you done.</p>
<p>Get anywhere with that.</p>
<p>Thing that they they did these free character mats that you get that far too restrictive.</p>
<p>Why the hell do I have to complete like three quarters of the matalan in order to get my free character mats for the new character.</p>
<p>What kind of.</p>
<p>I kind of misses the point.</p>
<p>That's totally misses the point.</p>
<p>She just do that.</p>
<p>What happens if cucina does that.</p>
<p>Which makes sense yeah I think that's fine I agree with that.</p>
<p>But yeah it's beyond me why the fuck.</p>
<p>Milani gets 5 seconds on the.</p>
<p>And then you're off.</p>
<p>It's like we're going back over here.</p>
<p>We're going back over.</p>
<p>So here's how I feel right cucina doesn't get.</p>
<p>To get milani to the final ascension.</p>
<p>I like a level her to 80.</p>
<p>Buy just farming the old the old school where.</p>
<p>And then when I get my free mats for doing her character quest.</p>
<p>I will use that to get a pastor final ascension.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>Otherwise i'm going to feel pressured to like speed run my way through most of nutlands content just so that I can get the match just so I can level a character and since cucina since cucina is going to need farming for anywhere.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is milani surfboard.</p>
<p>If I can only have one of those changes I would choose milani surfboard over the free character mats I still think the free character mods being as restrictive as they are is still stupid but.</p>
<p>If you save them for the final ascension and you just level the character normally.</p>
<p>Up to 80.</p>
<p>Then I guess it it takes some of the burden of the final ascension at least so like you can still make use of it but it does feel like it's intended use as being made redundant by how freaking restrictive it is.</p>
<p>Since I still think it's stupid.</p>
<p>But it's less stupid than milani getting 5 seconds on the surfboard.</p>
<p>I needed to get the computer tonight.</p>
<p>Are season.</p>
<p>You certainly want to disappointment.</p>
<p>Finish this next time I just finished it now for you.</p>
<p>We talk about it.</p>
<p>Yeah but I think I think it's a fair I think i'll make it fair points.</p>
<p>It's not like i'm saying this game needs to fundamentally change because I don't like something about it i'm saying.</p>
<p>Problems in the game with other characters why are we going back over.</p>
<p>And like I said.</p>
<p>I can hear like twitter stuns like arguing with me and what they would say and they'd be like on.</p>
<p>The mechanics at least for exploration it's just a shame they didn't have the quality of the world to explore in the first place anyway i'm going to shut up everybody.</p>
<p>I didn't think she get I had a suspicion cos I know this game too well.</p>
<p>And I swear to god right if there's a constellation that like extends that.</p>
<p>That is the biggest bullshit ever.</p>
<p>I'm going to have a look actually.</p>
<p>Turn on now.</p>
<p>Juvenile fan.</p>
<p>I'll find.</p>
<p>Constellations extend your surfing.</p>
<p>We might not we might not be done with this run.</p>
<p>Ok the first constellation increases sharks missiles by 66%.</p>
<p>30% less volume.</p>
<p>Yeah it does kind of but the way they've done it is they've made it so it consumes less floggers than.</p>
<p>Melanie's night souls blessing state is that the surf the surf thing I think that's the surf thing is that.</p>
<p>Ok maybe it's not.</p>
<p>Has surfing is called surfshark with breaker.</p>
<p>Good night souls blessing might be what they call you not says she's going to kill milani will get 60 nights all points and enter night souls blessing stairs.</p>
<p>A nice old blessing continuously consumes night soul points when they are depleted.</p>
<p>What is search fucking hardship I mean it's still not enough to fix her but it's still.</p>
<p>So yeah basically has c1 her first constellation.</p>
<p>Is like ok you will actually.</p>
<p>Through that energy at 30% less.</p>
<p>So you will get longer on the surfboard essentially.</p>
<p>Yeah that's.</p>
<p>That is bullshit.</p>
<p>Yeah that seems to be the only one.</p>
<p>Bright what do you need to ascend your bitch.</p>
<p>You need.</p>
<p>2 mark of the binding blessings do I have to kill ok there's an enemy here I need to kill for that.</p>
<p>I couldn't find the other one for cucina last night magic was like 4:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>Oh my god there's no way there's no fucking way boo I swear i'm deleting you i'm so done with you.</p>
<p>You are going in the same you know what i'm going to do i'm going to lock you in the nighty room with milani.</p>
<p>I don't care you can repeat other apart for all I care.</p>
<p>I'm sick of both here.</p>
<p>I can't believe it what is this I am cursed.</p>
<p>I'm so curse.</p>
<p>How do I get this weapon for cucina as well the new weapon.</p>
<p>On the plus side I will say that these characters like considering cucinas only level 40 in milan is only level 20.</p>
<p>Like yeah then.</p>
<p>Is there a performing much better than.</p>
<p>What shit yeah that's a good point what happens milani have awesome milani doesn't have any artefacts right now.</p>
<p>Yeah she's got a level one three star book or two star book whatever it is ok so I don't know what the hell she should have.</p>
<p>Why do you actually that has signature weapon yeah.</p>
<p>What do you want to give a.</p>
<p>Map of ayr.</p>
<p>Daughter cartels.</p>
<p>Weapons for these characters just give us something for now.</p>
<p>Charlotte the witches.</p>

<p>Punisher.</p>
<p>You do have climbing stamina but they've set it up in such a way that you can just.</p>
<p>Refresh you can eat you replenishes and there's like well there is a cooldown on it but the cool down is short of them the skill time so like you know once it wears out you just eat another.</p>
<p>Feels like it's just a bullshit let's just waste your time.</p>
<p>Ok well.</p>
<p>I guess they like they really are going for like the.</p>
<p>Sweaty climbing challenge mechanic but no when they let you sit there forever and you just got to stand there and wait 200 seconds before you can eat again.</p>
<p>It's like well ok you just wasting my time now.</p>
<p>Just fuck off already.</p>
<p>Ok is melanie doing more damage now.</p>
<p>Oh shit what the fuck.</p>

<p>I don't think it's the same voice actress star.</p>
<p>Can't remember louise.</p>
<p>That's it sarah miller crews and karina bourgon payment does not that's not right right I suppose because time on doesn't have an entry in here right.</p>

<p>How this might be how.</p>
<p>The hollow wagga nigga boo boo.</p>
<p>We might need to change our teams.</p>
<p>Do I need to actually.</p>
<p>Get some real characters hours.</p>
<p>Trial by fire ok girls this is how we do it.</p>
<p>But I can't really do that until my characters can actually take a hit.</p>
<p>I mean I could.</p>
<p>Play old characters but like.</p>
<p>Why would you want to why would you want to do that.</p>
<p>No one wants to do that.</p>
<p>Get down you fiend.</p>

<p>So we got milani.</p>
<p>Up to 50 I guess.</p>

<p>You should always give the player a physical well.</p>
<p>How are we meant to.</p>
<p>Are we meant to believe that the character ever left here.</p>
<p>And that's one of those little smoky things carries me up I don't think so if there's going to be anything but I don't see one.</p>

<p>Ok well this is not where the berries live.</p>
<p>I'm being attacked.</p>
<p>Kiss milani needed as she does she needs somehow I must have had enough of these already so they might be easy to find them.</p>
<p>Unless you just didn't need these a lot of level I don't know.</p>
<p>Where are all the berries.</p>
<p>You really sound like.</p>
<p>You saying shark with.</p>
<p>Don't you stop me i'm just here collecting resources.</p>
<p>Can I have anyone.</p>
<p>How about which funny area has been there.</p>
<p>How are you shut the fuck up i'm on.</p>
<p>I've already been scolded by time on.</p>
<p>Stadium of the sacred phlegm.</p>
<p>Tournaments are going to be held I found a new teleporter.</p>
<p>Set up.</p>
<p>How many how close are we now how many berries can we got some didn't we is that enough.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah level 50 cucina.</p>
<p>Ok so what will will like alternate cuz it makes.</p>
<p>Will I send melanie again.</p>
<p>Gold flame so she's she needs this disease area.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Level.</p>
<p>The dragon flapping around up there.</p>
<p>Who's got another fragile resin.</p>
<p>Are you a minor or.</p>
<p>Are street dancer I want.</p>
<p>I don't I mean this is not.</p>
<p>Difficult at all.</p>
<p>I think I should just assemble you know.</p>
<p>And if I was struggling I could just change my team.</p>
<p>But it's not even close.</p>
<p>I don't remember it doing that transformation last time.</p>
<p>See I need to do I need to do the wall level cos you guaranteed to get three at the next world level.</p>
<p>With a slight possibility to get for I literally just got two what a fucking shit.</p>
<p>Yeah now she's one shot.</p>
<p>So I couldn't save myself.</p>
<p>60 reson or whatever that was 40 reason.</p>
<p>Bulshit.</p>
<p>I also yet that's a good point it's cucina is oh yeah that's a good point actually.</p>
<p>But I can use condensed resin.</p>
<p>Fresh resin for bosses.</p>
<p>Used all my condensed resin.</p>
<p>At 17 fragiles.</p>
<p>Let's do the actual world ascension.</p>
<p>Quest.</p>
<p>I'll try it with my stuff team.</p>
<p>And in that way when i.</p>
<p>Start getting slightly bigger drops.</p>
<p>It's more efficient.</p>
<p>And i'll only level milani up to level 80.</p>
<p>And we'll use the free mats that you get for doing her quest.</p>
<p>What is a costa sam I think it's I think it costs the same number of months to get from 1 to 80 as it does to get from 80 to 90 and these mats get you to 60 so we're not going to have all of them but it'll be a good start.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok so if we check our ascension.</p>
<p>World quest world level ascension here we go.</p>
<p>To standard or pulsar.</p>
<p>I'll try my stuff team first.</p>
<p>Midsummer courtyard.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Yeah let's do it I mean.</p>
<p>Have the same as an even level but it'll be fine.</p>
<p>Ugly.</p>

<p>What's this a woman is on trial for beating her husband to death with his guitar collection just as first offender.</p>
<p>She says no first a g.</p>
<p>Domain is of this where.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>Overdoing the hype.</p>
<p>Yeah I feel like most of my disappointment comes from the way they can hype things up and then you go into the game and it feels like I don't know.</p>
<p>Some of it doesn't meet the expectations that the hype set.</p>
<p>Which sounds like a common thing right like commonly happens because that's kind of hype job or whatever but I don't know what that didn't I feel like that really happened to me and fontana.</p>
<p>I kind of had a feeling fontaine was gonna be.</p>
<p>Mountain.</p>
<p>Milani.</p>
<p>Some of the new features and stuff I don't know I feel.</p>
<p>A lot of them are falling a little short for me.</p>
<p>The free character matt's thing it's just I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah thanks for joining me I catch you later.</p>
<p>How many of these I got a farm.</p>
<p>I mean since it's her time but then it won't be for another 3 days after the day.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I need to find this at least five times and use my condensed resin on a link.</p>
<p>Also like this is going to be more.</p>
<p>What's the word.</p>
<p>Grindy.</p>
<p>Then it would be if I just came in with stronger teams to be honest but i'm.</p>

<p>As long as you have like a decent healer.</p>
<p>Ok I saw.</p>
<p>One more condensed after this.</p>
<p>Ask my five condensed runs on.</p>
<p>Do I need the next ascension before we can actually use last.</p>
<p>I'm so tired.</p>
<p>Sleep.</p>
<p>And then that should be.</p>
<p>New blueprints I guess is what it was.</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>What was the name of those talent books I guess I need to check.</p>
<p>Guide to conflicts.</p>
<p>Wow so we need to for the next three for the next three talents show you need 6:27.</p>
<p>I don't know how many you need after that.</p>
<p>Why are you making strange noises.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>I really want to get these new weapons for the characters.</p>
<p>I have no idea how I do that.</p>
<p>Don't be a blacksmith.</p>
<p>Don't be a blacksmith in that one yeah there's a blacksmith here.</p>
<p>Let's have a look.</p>
<p>Where is the blacksmith where is the blacksmith.</p>
<p>I think he's working.</p>
<p>Thank you for accepting the world's most difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Who would open the door in my face like that was disgusting.</p>
<p>This is very dangerous.</p>
<p>I like to buy me some weapons now.</p>
<p>You can do.</p>
<p>Forest regalia is that the.</p>
<p>Are you don't have an out new.</p>
<p>You know how anything new.</p>
<p>Already.</p>
<p>How to do something to unlock the new weapons.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Arena.</p>
<p>Ok these are these the ones I need I think this is the one I need footprint of the red by this is definitely the one that I need.</p>
<p>Ok so how do I get these.</p>
<p>Cooking ingredients.</p>
<p>Found in liquid foxtons.</p>
<p>Apparently I have what I need to get the ball already.</p>
<p>And I got 10 of the thingy things but I don't have the other thingy things.</p>
<p>Footprint of the rainbow.</p>
<p>So i've got 110 of these things.</p>
<p>Already.</p>
<p>I've got like 200 million more.</p>
<p>Are you think it was just sell it to me when you.</p>
<p>Off a pair of sigils.</p>
<p>I was just like the statue.</p>
<p>Let the fountain in fontaine.</p>
<p>Offer.</p>
<p>8:30.</p>
<p>Foxton zones am I supposed to know what that is.</p>
<p>I also need to try and find.</p>
<p>Alanis ascension mats oh my god I got to be honest like.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>And unlock reputation and it's like.</p>
<p>Fuck off.</p>
<p>Stupid fucking games.</p>
<p>And I lost 3 hours sleep last night so then I just feel like shit.</p>
<p>And that's also adding to the adding to the feeling that I just can't be fucking asked.</p>
<p>Find me all these mass.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know there's something.</p>
<p>I see some flickering every now and again.</p>
<p>Then I get the chest and he counts as being dead.</p>
<p>It's weird.</p>
<p>That is what I need.</p>
<p>Weather in get that or not.</p>
<p>Otherwise i'm literally just streaming me yawning.</p>
<p>Camera.</p>
<p>Play trader.</p>
<p>Yeah I get like I get most of it most of it's just a bullshit usual.</p>
<p>Skinner box.</p>
<p>Levelling thing which like I said it's disappointing because I was this is why I think i'm disappointed so far i'm disappointed with this patch.</p>
<p>But I understand that most of my disappointment comes from misunderstanding how.</p>
<p>Tell me a different expectation from.</p>
<p>Like everything's it's one of those weird things were like everything's hear that they said would be here but some of it is a lot closer.</p>
<p>A good example of that is melanie surfing right yeah milani surfing feels even better than it looks.</p>
<p>But it's over it's over in 5 seconds so what's the point.</p>
<p>And then other stuff is just like.</p>
<p>It's like.</p>
<p>Don't give a shit about any of the characters and you just.</p>
<p>Completely sort of.</p>
<p>Apathetically.</p>
<p>Play.</p>
<p>Passionate players who are passionate about the characters in the game playing this game.</p>
<p>Most fans of this game are incredibly passionate about this game.</p>
<p>And they know that.</p>
<p>Sort of course you going to want to play the new characters in the.</p>
<p>What's the time.</p>
<p>Yeah that's weird as well the whole in dwelling thing is weird I didn't know you'd be in dwelling enemies I thought.</p>
<p>You only in dwells.</p>
<p>Is then why would you even bother fighting it then.</p>
<p>What the fuck am I having at.</p>
<p>Add 8:00 a.m..</p>
<p>Even milan is even milani to fight with is a little bit disappointing.</p>
<p>And it just slows down the pace of combat a little bit too much.</p>
<p>In my opinion.</p>
<p>I don't know i'm i'm sleepy i'm tyre.</p>
<p>There's a 99% chance to win.</p>
<p>Tell me a 1% chance you'll lose and I would I would have fucking hit.</p>
<p>How liar of the universe.</p>
<p>Why is this just why is this just a sign that i'm definitely losing that.</p>
<p>Why do I feel like that's a sign that i'm definitely losing it and I fucking got a gina and you I would.</p>
<p>The reason I brought it up though is just.</p>
