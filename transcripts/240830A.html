<h3>From Live stream on Friday 30-08-2024 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBCfnOtNTEE​" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBCfnOtNTEE​</a></h3>
<p>The vegetarian sir.</p>
<p>Let us begin.</p>
<p>How's the apple for a conversation.</p>
<p>Conversation with a cauliflower.</p>
<p>Hell yeah.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>I did scuffle around an ear a bit yesterday.</p>
<p>Stream.</p>
<p>But I didn't do any anything major.</p>
<p>Sleepy face sleepy face you're such a disgrace.</p>
<p>Is almost has like this reminds me of some of the diamonds and inazuma you know.</p>
<p>Are you good.</p>
<p>I also went to get actually this might.</p>
<p>I need to do but I think this is.</p>
<p>I also did the web event.</p>
<p>Weapons for free so one of them is the footprint of the rainbow which is her best weapon.</p>
<p>Play specifically for her.</p>
<p>So but it wasn't you know what it's like it's not weapon levelling day no it's not weapon levelling they're naughty boy.</p>
<p>It's friday.</p>
<p>So we can't we can't level it.</p>
<p>Golfing.</p>
<p>Cinderella city.</p>
<p>Is.</p>
<p>You know she basically wants a lot of defense and a fair bit of chris but we got.</p>
<p>Set a 32.2 quick damages 75.6 she's getting energy recharge off the spear where she will get defence of the of a prophet once we can level that up.</p>
<p>This number goes down defence goes up even higher.</p>
<p>All of the damage that she does is a support is scaled off of defence so give her a defence goblet.</p>
<p>25.1% attack.</p>
<p>Energy recharge would have been better.</p>
<p>But we got an extra 14.6% defence on the feather which isn't bad in a little bit crit race.</p>
<p>I'm in a tax attack right so it could be worse.</p>
<p>Bit too much hp on that.</p>
<p>That that is just a shameful level 20 like artefact like looking at those numbers those substance like that doesn't even look like it's been rolled to the end it's like ok I wouldn't oh I wonder what this will roll with it's already max what the hell.</p>
<p>0.5% as you recharge 299 flat attack 82 flat em I think it hit em like three times.</p>
<p>And it might hickory once or something and crit rate of 6.6% that is an absolute dreadful piece for a but this or this was the piece that wouldn't drop I remember now.</p>
<p>Give me defence percent.</p>
<p>You love giving defense percent so just give me defense percent.</p>
<p>If I wanted fucking attack it would have been defensive.</p>
<p>What what was the main star on that one.</p>
<p>Let's keep going with it let's keep going with it this one might actually be better on her.</p>
<p>Attack percent.</p>
<p>Defense again she wants to fight but I mean flat defence is kind of trash.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>So do we have a defence because this is the off piece right do we have a defence go but I don't even think i've got that many defense goggles which makes sense because if I get if I get a defense goblet normally it just goes straight at the bin because who wants to defence goblet will it turns out she does other people I mean there we go right I could give it a geo damage bonus now and she gains an additional 18.7% crit damage.</p>
<p>Where's that put her out.</p>
<p>That's better actually.</p>
<p>Deal is up now.</p>
<p>Will truck will try this bill.</p>
<p>Now she's doing she's doing better damage now.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I feel better about this build.</p>
<p>I think what makes the biggest difference.</p>
<p>Nina is the fourth is the four piece artefacts as.</p>
<p>How loud is my tv yet ok that's why everything is quiet your end.</p>
<p>Turn this up now.</p>
<p>My milani I don't even know where to begin.</p>
<p>Melania stressing me out.</p>
<p>In which case I actually did get some pretty decent stuff for a can I stand on this crash.</p>
<p>Even better.</p>
<p>What do I do just follow this thing.</p>
<p>Melanie would have been kicked off a surfboard by now.</p>
<p>What is this thing what do you want from me.</p>
<p>I just had to touch the wall painting is that I just.</p>
<p>Touch the pains.</p>
<p>Make a wish.</p>
<p>Wish your fingers won't sticky and green.</p>
<p>Idiot you touch the green paint.</p>
<p>Oh yes yes adrian.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Can we start doing commissions.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Specifically.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>No it's not because we haven't unlocked reputation yet probably.</p>
<p>Which stream are we alive we are live on twitch right cuz stream elements didn't pop up.</p>
<p>Let me check.</p>
<p>Twitch i'm alive on twitch.</p>
<p>Everything looks fine.</p>
<p>Stream elements is dead.</p>
<p>It was killed by jeff bezos.</p>
<p>So she's automatically in the mouth can get that little.</p>
<p>I saw something over here I was going to interact with but I got lost I got distracted rather.</p>
<p>What's the challenge thing over there yes so what what should my what should my number one thing be I think I might just make a start on the icon quest cos the thing is right everything else is locked behind the archon quest so like.</p>
<p>Like I can get.</p>
<p>Cos I kind of need where is it I kind of need her mats as well I want to get these so then she can I can send us some more I can level her up a bit more but I had to use a lot of resin yesterday just to get those artefacts and things and tell them books.</p>
<p>Should go for the day.</p>
<p>Yeah we need to start using a.</p>
<p>We need to start using.</p>
<p>Ok so in terms of milani.</p>
<p>This is trash.</p>
<p>This needs to be hp.</p>
<p>It took forever just to get are goblets to drop but also that's the only goblet I got to drop off the other one and wouldn't you know it that one's edge p.</p>
<p>Yeah her son's her son's is tragic.</p>
<p>Are son's is quite tragic.</p>
<p>1000 flat hp and an additional 4.1% hp that's not bad for a feather.</p>
<p>Damage.</p>
<p>But yeah I couldn't get a single flower from that set to drop yesterday.</p>
<p>Trick damage circular but we got double hp look about 16.3 percent hp plus another 568 and a little bit of crap.</p>
<p>Not amazing.</p>
<p>So that's the same levelling there tomorrow.</p>
<p>Am I supposed to end well somebody.</p>
<p>I'm supposed to take a shower on here can I do on a surfboard.</p>
<p>High-speed lifting.</p>
<p>I just have to call I just have to recollect.</p>
<p>The two are missing I think.</p>
<p>Do i.</p>
<p>I miss one.</p>
<p>Challenge fails.</p>
<p>Spell the telegraphing to me now you probably didn't I just didn't read it.</p>
<p>I don't know how I feel about melania i'm just.</p>
<p>I can't help but feel a little disappointed.</p>
<p>I think the main reason is because a surfboard is so limited.</p>
<p>I'm all water and rock.</p>
<p>That's not very good.</p>
<p>It's not a very good combination.</p>
<p>Yep I got two jeans in one day yesterday.</p>
<p>I lost my 50/50 to jean of all people and then I get a gold on the standard banner out of nowhere and it's freaking jean again.</p>
<p>2 jeans in wonder and she wasn't even my selected 35 star I chose catching for my free 5235 star.</p>
<p>Don't say jean.</p>
<p>Right now i'm so mad with jean jean is like.</p>
<p>I told you shut up you long.</p>
<p>She needs oh my god we're actually out of blue magic that makes sense the amount of hydro characters i've built.</p>
<p>The amount of hydro characters i've been building is actually insane so i'm not surprised i'm law on blue rocks actually.</p>
<p>I mean jesus we built have we built siege win.</p>
<p>Yeah siege win farina neelu yolen.</p>
<p>My team is all water and rock.</p>
<p>And I don't think they really react with each other today.</p>
<p>On the run maybe I should have a fire unit in here but like.</p>
<p>Who.</p>
<p>Please the only fire unit in the aunt.</p>
<p>Actually like.</p>
<p>It's fine I mean even at world level 99 the game still.</p>
<p>Turn the easy it's not difficult.</p>
<p>So i'm not i'm not exactly struggling.</p>
<p>It's whatever.</p>
<p>Will peter are you going to answer my question who did you pick as your five star selector.</p>
<p>Got a reminder harbour.</p>
<p>Ok I guess we could do that how is my resin looking.</p>
<p>Ok will come and unlock this teleporter.</p>
<p>I don't know why i'm not really done just pissing around and exploring yet.</p>
<p>So rather than him interrupt the story.</p>
<p>If I give him some give him a bit of time to speak now and then you can be a good boy and be quiet during the story so we can enjoy it.</p>
<p>Not you boo.</p>
<p>Twitch drops.</p>
<p>I don't want to eat him.</p>
<p>I'm not hungry right now.</p>
<p>Where's the teleporter.</p>
<p>Ok let me check twitch what is going on with twitch.</p>
<p>So if we go to what's the score of the channel.</p>
<p>How am I not connected.</p>
<p>I am connected we talk about.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is why I didn't get the freaking stream rewards.</p>
<p>Refresh.</p>
<p>It says click on refresh once you have connected the accounts I have nothing's happening.</p>
<p>Ok now it just says connected.</p>
<p>Ok so that then I need to check my inventory or whatever don't I drop some rewards.</p>
<p>Inventory.</p>
<p>How does a withering waves one as well.</p>
<p>Ok so i'm now I should now be earning them on my own.</p>
<p>Twitch.</p>
<p>Stop being a naughty twitch ok I will go over the cake.</p>
<p>Go over the cake.</p>
<p>It's very far away.</p>
<p>I got my good morning how are the teeth.</p>
<p>How are the teeth.</p>
<p>Earning my own drops otherwise.</p>
<p>Yes I was annoying if you're if you're in stream.</p>
<p>Yeah I bet.</p>
<p>Yuri if you are in stream.</p>
<p>Otherwise I will ignore you.</p>
<p>Play i'm happy to jump in if anybody wants to join on stream for anything.</p>
<p>What about if you bought them.</p>
<p>Is that legal the candidate if you bought them.</p>
<p>So they're just removing old skins for new people basically.</p>
<p>Why did they get in trouble or something I don't understand what's going on.</p>
<p>Oh you know what it might be wrong.</p>
<p>Take actuals pants offer.</p>
<p>Spin the wind you're not spin to win the winans and the sun zero wrong game.</p>
<p>I mean just your drill spins a little bit I guess but.</p>
<p>Also feel like this kids just actively promoting gambling at this point spinner when guys.</p>
<p>Are we still get to use the skin right.</p>
<p>Like that skin.</p>
<p>That's ok then.</p>
<p>Here we go reputation.</p>
<p>I think I have to do the icon quest first ok I need to remember where this is because he's not on the map is he.</p>
<p>I know where to go.</p>
<p>So are they going to do now that means is going to turn down the fan service then doesn't it cuz like otherwise.</p>
<p>It's it's not that bad is it.</p>
<p>I mean I personally wish they would.</p>
<p>I personally wish I personally wish they would like you know claw that little bit more.</p>
<p>Because you know.</p>
<p>Turn off the alarm.</p>
<p>But yeah I mean other than other than actual being a bit too lewd for my tests for a you know child character.</p>
<p>It's a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Turn alarm off for.</p>
<p>I left.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>You know this this is still an issue as well for me in the game I feel like.</p>
<p>When you especially if you've got new characters to build.</p>
<p>Send another issue I have.</p>
<p>What is the map of one server before I get stuck in.</p>
<p>Anywhere near anything new.</p>
<p>Boom yeah somet.</p>
<p>Yes soon as you come near anything new then boom you just get this front loaded tutorial added.</p>
<p>You just get this front loaded tutorial added to your tutorial section.</p>
<p>And it's like whether you're ready to do it on or not yet you just there so what I end up doing is I end up getting another one now another one just came up and this is what I mean like.</p>
<p>So what I end up as soon as I got when you.</p>
<p>I always end up with 52 tiles that have ignored because i'm not ready to deal with any of them yet and then when I when i'm ready to deal with one of those things then i'm like struggling to find the bloody tutorial in the collection.</p>
<p>Make make it so that everything in this game like activates as soon as you go anywhere near it and I feel like it might maybe it would be better if you actually you know said start challenger whatever and manually activate them.</p>
<p>Remind me again or something like that so you can say dismiss for now or whatever and then the next time you come back to that thing it will show up again for you.</p>
<p>I don't know I just I feel like the game just like it vomit all of its tutorials out at me as soon as the new regent comes out but it's like yeah i'm not doing it's like i'm not doing that yet.</p>
<p>Yeah I think she is.</p>
<p>I'm still completely clueless how to play melanie.</p>
<p>Completely clueless how she works.</p>
<p>Katrina.</p>
<p>Yeah the only character i'm disappointed with is melania at the moment.</p>
<p>And it's twofold.</p>
<p>Zion.</p>
<p>Guitar girl.</p>
<p>I will do eventually.</p>
<p>Especially when your team isn't fully built yet.</p>
<p>Yeah a little bit grindy.</p>
<p>Do in 2 in a raw ok so we need to be over there then right.</p>
<p>Get to the next telephone.</p>
<p>And I can stay on my surfboard if I just.</p>
<p>Charge up my flog a log.</p>
<p>How do you get that by the way it's probably going to be part of the not one question.</p>
<p>These things are out of no idea what these are how they work.</p>
<p>Has real thing doesn't stout for very long though when you use it as a support thing.</p>
<p>I got no flogger logger right now so I can't go very far in my little drill which is annoying.</p>
<p>Play some shell.</p>
<p>Are water and rock yeah I don't know I don't know if this is a good team I feel like this is a weird team that i'm playing.</p>
<p>Water and rock because they don't really work together today.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I want to use cucina so i'm like.</p>
<p>Some of the elements but it reacts with others.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't know how to get the park pets.</p>
<p>I don't know how to get that pet but it's in the backpack under quests I think.</p>
<p>Yeah cuz I know it's not in the event adverts thing.</p>
<p>I feel like maybe maybe my stamina increase you know when my world level increased is that how it works I can't remember how.</p>
<p>Stamina increase but I definitely feel like since I ascended my world level I feel like this stomach feels bigger to me.</p>
<p>Why can't I why you so short cucina how am I going to get that now.</p>
<p>Are you seriously meant to climb all the way up there.</p>
<p>Jesus.</p>
<p>There's gonna be some stuff up there as well right.</p>
<p>6000.</p>
<p>Rice puddings to refresh your stomach.</p>
<p>Is there somewhere where it gives you the stars.</p>
<p>240 what was it before.</p>
<p>Climber.</p>
<p>I'm not even i'm not even a tune to jio I don't think.</p>
<p>You fucking dick heads.</p>
<p>You dick head.</p>
<p>Why you shit a white shirt.</p>
<p>Continue won't even be able to get this for you.</p>
<p>If i.</p>
<p>Had better am maybe if you fucking job.</p>
<p>Bitch.</p>
<p>I didn't even want you I pulled you because you were on the fucking double banner with gun you and it was before they.</p>
<p>Play field ganges 50/50 dammit but then I thought hang on a minute.</p>
<p>How the fuck would I get jean lee if I failed genius for 50 and then I realised.</p>
<p>Is he was on page 1 and she was on.</p>
<p>And now that can't happen because it remembers which page you are on but it didn't then.</p>
<p>Didn't then.</p>
<p>But he can be useful.</p>
<p>John lee you even more useless to me than you than you were and you were already pretty useless.</p>
<p>It's fine we'll do this the way the.</p>
<p>Direct me to I just don't want to I don't want to climb that big long thing and go all the way up there I didn't even know if that's going to be possible.</p>
<p>I don't want to climb that what about the event you can do is gust of wind right.</p>
<p>When are you finally got to use.</p>
<p>Goodbye then a good boy vinny.</p>
<p>Penguin.</p>
<p>Pair to win.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Peter when alerts peter when all right let's get cachina.</p>
<p>Melanie.</p>
<p>Money back out.</p>
<p>Ok so which where's the next top are we got the we got the pyrocalm.</p>
<p>Log.</p>
<p>I need my flag.</p>
<p>Is there a flog a log thing anywhere.</p>
<p>Let's ride for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>I still think that's outrageous.</p>
<p>Outrageous.</p>
<p>I finally saw alexandra I finally saw that that way crying thing that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Live stream announcement it was from a specie gave it I think it was gamescom and what was the question on youtube should I dps that your four-star free character I wouldn't build her as a dps well you could do but I wouldn't know how to build a dbs.</p>
<p>So this the standard way to builder is to.</p>
<p>Is the new nutland weapon.</p>
<p>Use the new nutland set for pizza I can show you in a bit.</p>
<p>And then you scale she scales off of.</p>
<p>You drill.</p>
<p>Ashley planner off field do the hop out of that.</p>
<p>I'll give my hotel spear well if you want you can just go you literally click a button right if you if you google free not land weapons and you got a higher lab you literally click a button can actually you i'd and you get three of the new not on weapons in your mail immediately definitely worth doing because it saves you.</p>
<p>Specifically for katrina.</p>
<p>Are scales off of defence the only polar in the game currently the scales of defence that's why not for her also best free to play a weapon is the other one you get in the male ring of yaksha and this one's built specifically for her pretty much because these are basically work with the new knight fledged whatever it's called you know mechanic for not long characters.</p>
<p>Youtube video.</p>
<p>Weapons in google.</p>
<p>You have to scroll down a bit.</p>
<p>Where did I collect youtube.</p>
<p>I'll get there it is.</p>
<p>Ok i'll post the link.</p>
<p>So you just enter.</p>
<p>What's your accounts.</p>
<p>Click chia and it just shows up straight in your mouth you can skip this you can skip all this nonsense.</p>
<p>And then there you go you get your ii weapons you just click cheer cheer to claim rewards and you get the footprint of the rainbow ring of the action and earth shaker and ascension material bundle.</p>
<p>Are the side must be the earth share crying.</p>
<p>Specifically built for them essentially.</p>
<p>This is my issue with melanie.</p>
<p>I've got no flogger log right now.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>And I need to go over towards that teleporter right so i'm gonna have to.</p>
<p>How to swim the rest of the way.</p>
<p>She got.</p>
<p>Irish levels up i'm not sure.</p>
<p>I know if you get her at c1 you can.</p>
<p>Interested in her.</p>
<p>Recommended knots to go for the weapon.</p>
<p>Is there a better options like the free weapon that we just get in the male there is actually arguably better than.</p>
<p>Depends on how you plant the user apparently.</p>
<p>General recommendation is to go for a c1 over a weapon.</p>
<p>I was prefer to do that anyway because at least you're building pity for the next character if you if you're not getting c1 which is always good.</p>
<p>Random products I swear she says.</p>
<p>Bollocks.</p>
<p>Play some flog now.</p>
<p>Did I just get another commission.</p>
<p>Clean rewards yeah I found new catherine in a new area as well.</p>
<p>Yeah so these things if you attack them there we go I think it'll be a reward at the end if I get them all.</p>
<p>You dropped it all right.</p>
<p>Jinx my bank account rice.</p>
<p>What is this thing disabled activate.</p>
<p>Disable and then we've got a challenge do you want to do the challenge.</p>
<p>It looks like zip lines doesn't it.</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>I got I think I got shot down I think that's what happened there ok so r2.</p>
<p>Stand on so you don't have to panic too much.</p>
<p>What is deactivate disable.</p>
<p>Ok then this one maybe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I say set the volume on.</p>
<p>And what's this.</p>
<p>Touch.</p>
<p>I have no idea what I just did.</p>
<p>So I can get.</p>
<p>Is there any missing a few now there's one over there one over there we should head back over this way then.</p>
<p>And it looks like this is the most amount of ocean will ever have to deal with I don't think.</p>
<p>All right let's find out.</p>
<p>Stamina bar goes down.</p>
<p>I didn't even think that was a stomach first I thought it was like you know how many books have you got or whatever.</p>
<p>Ok yeah I mean as long as you flogger looks for you.</p>
<p>You can actually surf for quite.</p>
<p>I still don't know why they want to sleep you freaking surf as long as you want.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess that's not too bad in that one then at least.</p>
<p>Yeah so don't get a.</p>
<p>The world.</p>
<p>Whether you know she can replace farina but.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>This is my first time.</p>
<p>Raining raining in that one I think.</p>
<p>320.</p>
<p>Where is the pause.</p>
<p>So did that help you out.</p>
<p>Originally I was going to go a farm all the things to get the billet to craft the weapon but I still haven't got any of the fruits that I need for her specific weapon and I was like oh my god.</p>
<p>Where are these things.</p>
<p>Do you like to get you to go to the weird little hoyolab website a lot outside of the game and I have no idea why for like daily logins events claiming things I don't know what that's about.</p>
<p>Teleporter.</p>
<p>Write above me.</p>
<p>Is it up there.</p>
<p>Yeah we follow these zipline markers they'll probably be a little dragon guy we can possess yes there's the blue marker for it look.</p>
<p>Ok I think I get it now so basically I in the well that.</p>
<p>Marcus wants to come with me for some reason.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Does shallow water beach looks great it's.</p>
<p>Make a good fishing spot.</p>
<p>Is sucks so badly that that's how I ended up with you.</p>
<p>I'll catch myself another travel guide.</p>
<p>Fishing it's been a while since we last add fish you caught and cooked yourself plus it's about time you give marcus a test of your culinary wizardry.</p>
<p>How about you do the fishing this time time on.</p>
<p>Please tell me this is a thing can we just dump time on it a fishing spot and then go off and have our own adventure then come back in time on like we basically time on the fishing slave oh that would be amazing please tell me this is a real thing off of her old microser how could you catching permanent out with her own words like that alright then but we want payment is no idea what she'll catch if anything.</p>
<p>Before that is angela prime on needs a nice tidy environment to work a magic in what is the line gets snacked and all that junk floating around in the water.</p>
<p>Tidy up the area all these wooden planks are in the way break them quietly.</p>
<p>Just logged in a clean my hoodie now changing my mclaren hoodie what do you mean hoodie.</p>
<p>What hoodie.</p>
<p>Are goodies you said hoodie.</p>
<p>Can you get a free hoodie.</p>
<p>Suddenly the surface is still as a mirror without a ripple in size.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with the water here the fish don't seem to want to come out at all.</p>
<p>Also.</p>
<p>What's the forecast and wait wait.</p>
<p>You've got this you've got this.</p>
<p>It's not as easy for you.</p>
<p>What that's not efficient in a it's a bottle and it's even tied to one of the wooden planks at the fishing spot well the fact you always cut strange things to make palm and feel a little better place and bile.</p>
<p>Can you catch waste of all time to anyway seeing this time i'm already called it we might as well take a.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Start reading.</p>
<p>Why did not work.</p>
<p>Oh my god took your time.</p>
<p>Who also tried to tell a joke what's blue and not very heavy light blue.</p>
<p>I swear boo if you tell the scarecrow joke today.</p>
<p>Could it be in these two the left behind the power stuff just now people who are the success with fishing are pretty scary huh seems like they're using this bottle to pass messages to each other we better throw it back.</p>
<p>Has taken at the base.</p>
<p>Sing highlands struggling you and marcus grub hold of her but the line is being pulled with such unstoppable force.</p>
<p>Funny with a mighty club the fish escape.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>Well i've got I don't even need money.</p>
<p>Almost caught up with so close.</p>
<p>Ok so I guess we're going back here now.</p>
<p>Let's give it a try next time.</p>
<p>Where to say it's not done yet we have to wait for play compile to finish cooking it first once the fish is finished grilling everyone sits down and eats their fill.</p>
<p>Wet stevens grilled fish goes that was something special.</p>
<p>Time if you want any fish that is.</p>
<p>Ok I got 20 primo farts at least.</p>
<p>Do I have.</p>
<p>Have I earned any drops yet.</p>
<p>I'll take those i'll take those.</p>
<p>We got some achievements.</p>
<p>Turn my premiums.</p>
<p>Twitch drops.</p>
<p>But I still need 30 more primaries to do a poll.</p>
<p>I do actually have some genesis crystals left.</p>
<p>God dammit.</p>
<p>Also the shop resets visit tomorrow.</p>
<p>2 days time.</p>
<p>Sweetheart an extra 10 poles there.</p>
<p>95.</p>
<p>How do I get rid of the chat because it's just on the screen constantly now.</p>
<p>Pika pika.</p>
<p>You pollute my game you know with these messages.</p>
<p>I don't know how it works.</p>
<p>Assistant.</p>
<p>Stop reading.</p>
<p>I don't know whether he's fully fixed yet coming in and out of reading.</p>
<p>Is we'll find out soon enough.</p>
<p>So yeah there was a teleporter I was aiming for that was ohio well I was about to test it might be that one i'm not sure.</p>
<p>Well one.</p>
<p>And then his tongue.</p>
<p>How much is on they got r2 his tongue latches onto these.</p>
<p>Little swirly things.</p>
<p>Ok I forget I always forget that he gets a flight to set on god damn it this is for like people like supplier isn't it but that's the thing right that's for zepler so that she she doesn't she can actually play the game but it causes me to fall off because i'm used to panicking and having to find the next one before the ground so actually ends up fucking me up.</p>
<p>I'm trying.</p>
<p>How do I get over there now though it's like so annoying.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't even know if I can.</p>
<p>He doesn't sprint.</p>
<p>So I feel like if the problem with this I feel like if you make a mistake it's just cost you even more time.</p>
<p>You are slowly walks and you got to go back to the very first zip line.</p>
<p>Right so.</p>
<p>See if we can do this.</p>
<p>I set myself on fire I say ask good oh stop it.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Oh my god what do you want from me.</p>
<p>And now I have a flame breath.</p>
<p>Oh my god you just shut me off the.</p>
<p>She can't climb mountains you get any climb so high oh my god I hate this thing i'm just not used to it yet that's all.</p>
<p>It wasn't wasn't the way you used to.</p>
<p>And she's she's the opposite of melanie it's so inconsistent right cuz she she seems to charge her own she she runs a heron power first and then burns the frog log but melanie on the surfboard seems to burn the flogger log and then she's got her own stamina that burns after that.</p>
<p>You expected to be the same way around for both.</p>
<p>Seems like it's not it's a little confusing.</p>
<p>I don't want to fight you really what am I even doing it but i'm trying to get over there honey so I can in 12 him or whatever it's called.</p>
<p>What's that clef.</p>
<p>I mean there's one over there.</p>
<p>Right so double jump.</p>
<p>And you can reach the top of that ladder.</p>
<p>Right there's a flog a log metre here.</p>
<p>Charger.</p>
<p>Shiny.</p>
<p>Where is the.</p>
<p>Ok but yeah yeah this was this was the way I point that is underground I think.</p>
<p>Ok i'll next waypoint is over there.</p>
<p>Now we did sink quite low down.</p>
<p>And I don't know that I want to climb all the way back out of this thing i'm just going to teleport back up for now.</p>
<p>Snapshot thing.</p>
<p>Viewpoint.</p>
<p>Statue.</p>
<p>It went very quiet in the stream did everybody leave.</p>
<p>The time on scare everybody wear.</p>
<p>There's another one over here.</p>
<p>Over in the east.</p>
<p>No I don't want to cook.</p>
<p>About this.</p>
<p>I'm still watching you.</p>
<p>I'm watching you.</p>
<p>Out off the screen.</p>
<p>Cos I haven't used that function that much since I changed my assistant in the whole system of.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Set an alarm we actually have individual reputation for each tribe I believe for the first time so there's actually multiple reputations in that one not just.</p>
<p>Do you go up.</p>
<p>That's very high I could go.</p>
<p>I don't know why this teleporter is probably not up here.</p>
<p>Congrats.</p>
<p>By guessing how.</p>
<p>Do you mean you want me to guess how you managed to get it.</p>
<p>Well normally like the true the true ending is it the true ending like the good ending yeah there's only like extra things you need to do as an like you've got a.</p>
<p>Pick the right paths or whatever to get.</p>
<p>I defeat some.</p>
<p>Yeah I need to know whether.</p>
<p>67 things nice.</p>
<p>Climb longer than everybody else maybe that's part of a kid.</p>
<p>Something.</p>
<p>What kind of overall stamina buff was applied but thinking back actually I think the way you peter you'll notice you're in a new game I think the way you actually increase stamina in this game is through statues don't you.</p>
<p>When you're when you're starting out I think each time you or is it with wall level I can't remember.</p>
<p>I thought it was statue levels for.</p>
<p>Statutes correct.</p>
<p>Set up my screen forever.</p>
<p>Yes I i haven't levelled any of not on statues yet.</p>
<p>Even i've been collecting a lot of paeroa.</p>
<p>Play rocky list.</p>
<p>So I don't think i've gotten a.</p>
<p>An increase in stamina that way I also don't remember what my stomach I used to say it says 240 now.</p>
<p>Don't know if that's what it's always been.</p>
<p>I'll be on food cool down.</p>
<p>For how long.</p>
<p>248 seconds.</p>
<p>You do you have one.</p>
<p>Some oz.</p>
<p>Yeah it's also this game and noise the the food killed on really doesn't know me in this game.</p>
<p>Another reason is like you have to be in the game letting the game time take away as well like you can't just sit there actually you might be able to sit there and watch it in the.</p>
<p>Until you go into your inventory and then when you go into your inventory it pauses so you have to go back into the game and wait for it's like oh my god you could have made this morning if you tried.</p>
<p>A listing tower of fantasy.</p>
<p>The food cool down imagine might do that in here to be honest.</p>
<p>I need an nre.</p>
<p>If I set up my nra does it show me the food cool down at least.</p>
<p>Can you make em for meals meals ready anytime i've been mri and i'm getting confused.</p>
<p>That's what i'm talking about.</p>
<p>Where is the thing is that's not even gadgets is it where the hell you gadgets these are the gadgets.</p>
<p>Where's my meals anytime bullshit thing.</p>
<p>What the hell is an re.</p>
<p>Right so they sure you.</p>
<p>No yes it's work so.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>How do I change the meals in this thing.</p>
<p>Play kids.</p>
<p>How do I that's equipping it now how do I change my meal r3 or r3 so I can have a healing one and that's a red one can I have a stamina one in there or not.</p>
<p>Rice pudding.</p>
<p>Only the meals that hail so it's like this slot is for healing.</p>
<p>Resurrection.</p>
<p>There isn't an nre stamina slot so I literally can't.</p>
<p>What's the thing that annoys me oh my god.</p>
<p>So you can't even put a quick link to a stamina meal.</p>
<p>Nre.</p>
<p>It's so dumb.</p>
<p>Yes so like it really does it really annoys me like if you go to insist on this stupid stamina system at least give us better access to it.</p>
<p>But the only way to refresh stamina is to manually go into your inventory manually go over the third.</p>
<p>Manually find something that's stamina.</p>
<p>Rice pudding then I can see that i've got to wait another 140 seconds but i'd better get back to the game where I can't see it because it's paused right now it's like are you fucking serious.</p>
<p>I love this game but where it feels my god.</p>
<p>And when tara fantasy did it better that's when you know that part shit right.</p>
<p>In the gadget.</p>
<p>In my food gadget.</p>
<p>Not only that but it shows me the cool down in the gadget which is great.</p>
<p>Not only that they also refresh the cool down faster than it wears out so there's no waiting.</p>
<p>So you can climb tariff fant.</p>
<p>4 years later and we're still dealing with this it's just like for good sex.</p>
<p>And why these why these are such.</p>
<p>Another 63 seconds.</p>
<p>It's like a sis just feels like it's just wasting my time for no reason there's nothing more boring than seeing my character just hanging off a cliff for fucking 240 seconds while I wait before I can use my next domino refresher.</p>
<p>God damn attention.</p>
<p>Oh man.</p>
<p>Make a sound of the skin is actually my favourite game.</p>
<p>Pause yeah the stamina.</p>
<p>Stamina food replenishing in genshin impact is like one of the worst things about the game.</p>
<p>It's so annoying.</p>
<p>A game is like thousands of systems right I make them myself.</p>
<p>Without a doubt the best character.</p>
<p>Best characters by far.</p>
<p>Right can we finally eat another rice pudding we can finally eat another rice pudding jesus christ ok we can finally get to the shopping list.</p>
<p>Being someone who makes games myself it's it's good to like analyse and you know.</p>
<p>Understand what's frustrating and what might maybe could be better in these games anyway because.</p>
<p>But I think i've never seen a game get as much right as this game gets right to be.</p>
<p>I think they absolutely know most things but that.</p>
<p>10..</p>
<p>Am I getting a shield.</p>
<p>They build a game is just a bunch of systems.</p>
<p>And it's it's not easy to change the underlying systems that make the game so their character system probably doesn't support.</p>
<p>It's like the lip syncing thing right like why why do they have lip sync.</p>
<p>I know myself when I make these games right a lot goes into making the systems that drive these games and unravelling all of that during a games life cycle and then trying to feed new systems into it is insanely difficult to do.</p>
<p>It's in most cases.</p>
<p>Yeah well again this comes down the system's probably because.</p>
<p>They do have so I think it's because of the way the bone rigging animation system works right because if you look in the game files they have they have adult female adult male child female you know child male and basically the I think the animation born rigging systems have to know which body type to apply to that's that seems to be why it is and that's why a lot of the characters will share the same you know the same walks the same climbs and stuff like.</p>
<p>So trying to.</p>
<p>Add unique animations in a system that doesn't support it is not as easy as you might think because the system just doesn't supply so they'd have to rip the current system out and build an entirely new system to support it and I think it's fine I think it's great I know what you're saying and they've obviously done that in star rail because they've learnt from genshin and if they had the money to do it in the time to do it by then but when genshin was first built it was like it already custom 100 million or whatever.</p>
<p>So I understand why.</p>
<p>System the weather built the system it just doesn't support that like they'd have to literally build an entirely new system for all the characters and then look at how many characters are in the game they'd have to remodel all the characters reanimate all the characters like you have no idea how much work that would be they may as well make a new game at that point.</p>
<p>Yeah but considering this is like the predecessor to honkai impact 3rd the amount of the amount of difference in quality between this and honkai impact 3rd is astounding.</p>
<p>And the continuing to make improvements like that with each new game that they make.</p>
<p>But yeah when the when the system was built to you know to work a certain when only support a certain number of features it's not easy to just add new ones that doesn't it doesn't work like that sadly.</p>
<p>It has to be sort of built from the ground up to support it in the first place.</p>
<p>This is taking me a month.</p>
<p>He keeps getting his freaking shield back as well this is actually insane.</p>
<p>There's gonna be something that I don't understand about this enemy type probably like there'll be some specific but it's like pyro or something a specific element that burns his shield away quickly or something.</p>
<p>Broadcast.</p>
<p>Why does every female girl run like this.</p>
<p>It's probably because when the characters put into the game that will be like a database category it's like the the creators will have to say ok yep this character is female girl and then it knows which animations to paul and how the bone rigging supposed to work same way all the body types the same stuff so like they have to they have to work within the limitations of the system that they built for it.</p>
<p>Yeah I wish we could do that.</p>
<p>Still no sign of that.</p>
<p>I agree this planet there's plenty of things could be improved definitely but I still think this is the best.</p>
<p>The best game.</p>
<p>Tell me the best game i've ever played to be honest and at this point like this games they've spent like about a billion dollars on this at this point.</p>
<p>Play this is pretty much as.</p>
<p>When is it could possibly be and it's astounding I think it's actually think about just think about how much world is here now and it's like it's all top quality stuff.</p>
<p>When you look at what's here like oh my god it's it's absolutely amazing it's it's unbelievable.</p>
<p>Please recycle the same old stuff.</p>
<p>In fact you know what I would I actually think it's better than doesn't have a skip.</p>
<p>Because all I do in wuthering wav.</p>
<p>Skip the story.</p>
<p>So he's why right.</p>
<p>I feel like genshin's one of those games that recycle are you kidding.</p>
<p>Have you seen this map.</p>
<p>What's recycled.</p>
<p>You should play snow brake any other gacha game any other gacha game this is not recycling.</p>
<p>See you in the game or something.</p>
<p>New zealand's new stories new characters new everything.</p>
<p>New puzzles new traversal mechanics every like i've never seen so much new stuff so no they do not recycle content I mean they have to recycle some stuff cuz like jesus christ.</p>
<p>Another couple of the events a few times but even when they come back they've been refined and they've got new features even the events are unique and they're just filler.</p>
<p>Play still make them unique from scratch each time it's it's unbelievable how much work goes in a lot.</p>
<p>What's the next event or another double drop oh great.</p>
<p>Double drops.</p>
<p>Like the everything is brand new in this game all the time and it's a lot of it's just.</p>
<p>Benson stuff as well it's actually mind blowing how much original conan is in this game.</p>
<p>I just don't ok can you can you give an example.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of what you mean.</p>
<p>Anything that's recycled in even across the characters really every character is unique they have unique moves unique kits.</p>
<p>That's a system limitation.</p>
<p>I don't have all the characters right.</p>
<p>Ok so you just said.</p>
<p>You name two characters that have similar kits right there are five characters per raw here and I don't have anywhere near close to all the characters but there's 15 20 25 30 3540 5550 5560.</p>
<p>There's 69 characters I have 69 characters.</p>
<p>Try thinking of 69 unique elemental skills.</p>
<p>Look up for a game 69 unique alts for a game and you've got like six elements to work with yeah of course you going to get some similar kits.</p>
<p>Across lake 100 characters in this game now when you've got to come up with 100 unique characters with unique skills unique olds unique moves you're going to get some similarities but I think I think like yeah okay hotel might be quite similar is it's a bit of a stretch to say that it's just recycling stuff I think that's.</p>
<p>Play farther from the truth I would struggle to come up with 10 unique things never mind 100 it's insane.</p>
<p>I think the two closest characters I can think of.</p>
<p>To each other would be.</p>
<p>And also yo-yo heels.</p>
<p>Bunny on the other hand like I actually feel a lot about wooden west I got I got what's what was the acre look like I call a judge judy.</p>
<p>Big boobs with a red hair and they literally feel identical to each other aside from the fact that their elements.</p>
<p>I mean they I guess they have some subtle differences but they don't feel different enough to me to feel like i'm really playing a different character they just feels like the elements different and they feel very flirty as well they're all sushi and floaty and i'll feel the same to me.</p>
<p>And that's just like across two characters that came out recently.</p>
<p>British heart like them.</p>
<p>Right so how far away are we from this thing.</p>
<p>Yeah I think this game's biggest issues if I was going to say what what I think is this game's biggest issues it's still missing quite a lot of quality of life stuff like artefact loadouts yeah replayable stories.</p>
<p>The stamina refresh.</p>
<p>King food with massive cooldowns for no reason why can't melanie get on an officer bottle whenever she wants.</p>
<p>Do you like that restrictive stuff.</p>
<p>Why is boone not reading that.</p>
<p>Remind me to compare.</p>
<p>What time does sanctuary on the same stuff but.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>I wasn't looking for stuff to do engines for within the first couple of weeks but I wasn't I was in war.</p>
<p>It's like looking at the time frame as well right.</p>
<p>Because it gets harder not to recycle content along with the games being outright.</p>
<p>The longer the more characters you are the harder is to make them all unique the more content you've got the harder is to keep it keep it all unique and fresh obviously that's his common sense so wuthering waves being as new as it is if it's struggling with some of these things that genshin struggling with now I think.</p>
<p>That's not a good sign.</p>
<p>Yeah they have the important thing is they have good stuff that are very talented they're so good at what they do everything they make is top notch.</p>
<p>You know I need the clearly are trying to make new stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah I think a lot of people love to hear on genshin and hiya I think just because of how successful they are it's like microsoft right when microsoft became such a dominating.</p>
<p>Me in games because games.</p>
<p>Right which is like the the trashiest gacha games where there's barely any game player and the whole thing is just a vehicle that sell you characters right which these does plenty of them out there that exist and clearly they're not interested in making a good game they just interested in recycling them as the least amount of content that they can spend as little as possible and make as much money off the players possible that's not someone who's interested in making a good game.</p>
<p>And deliver the least you know the least I can get away with delivering eu so that's one way that these companies can run on the other hand you know the other if you wanted to say the I would say these guys are close as you can get to being the ideal company on the other end of that spectrum which is a company that genuinely wants to make good games that genuinely care about player experience.</p>
<p>Level my data to level 40 gems.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>If you're a gacha game company that cares about making good games I think that's basically what we're seeing you get stuff like this that's trying new zealand it's not going to get everything right all the time because they're not scared to try new things and I think you know genshin was a huge risk for them it paid off obviously but it might not have and then they still try things within those games and not everybody likes everything not everything's always going to be a home run but I think it's it's important to take risks right otherwise you end up with like ubisoft games right every assassin's creed is the same as the last one you get these carbon copy recycled you know cash grabs that are safe you know that's that's the that's that's what you get if all they care about is is giving investors share price like share money back is ok will release the surf game because it's sold well last time so we'll make the next a new game with different characters slightly different map you know recycled stuff that we're talking about that's the safeway but I think yeah I think how you have demonstrated time again that they're not they're not fair to take risks kiss their passionate about trying to find you know fun stuff and make good games and includes all that they're actually interested in making it again but the downside of that is you're not always going to get it right.</p>
<p>Pat mechanics.</p>
<p>Some people are just going to prefer or the mechanics over others I think that might also be what happens a lot.</p>
<p>Some people prefer like a faster combat style genshin's a lot slower than words got us it's got a more methodical.</p>
<p>Slower deeper more varied mechanic mechanic to it and I like both but it depends what murder man.</p>
<p>Faster to little bit more shallow with its mechanics but it's faster sort of more reactive.</p>
<p>And I like both but they are very different from each other.</p>
<p>So like engines more lead back and chill and take your time and set up the reactions and stuff like that where is endless is more like edge of your seat got a dodge gotta react gotta get in there when i've got my little timing window they're very different playstyles but I like them both for different reasons.</p>
<p>It's like a slow dance with the with the enemy.</p>
<p>Rather than a manic manic button mash.</p>
<p>Yeah I just I just I know that that is the overall.</p>
<p>I know that's the overall narrative on the internet right now.</p>
<p>And I just think it's wrong.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>Ok I reported I reported a couple of books to rouen that are still in the game and.</p>
<p>How are they listening anymore or less or whatever like I don't think they're going to fix either of those books they're still in the game right now.</p>
<p>Where is the the nice best friend company that's listening to my feedback and really cares what I think i'm going to just evil money money grabbers who don't listen to their funds but then literally they they kind of just sort of showed that they've been trying their best to.</p>
<p>Otherwise a lot of the changes that we see in this part we wouldn't be in the game.</p>
<p>Well I don't think I don't think that's true right I think.</p>
<p>I think the problem is they they do they aren't.</p>
<p>They haven't been as communicative maybe with the communities they should have been.</p>
<p>To add collier life now we've been getting quality of life but it's been manly and new players rather than existing class.</p>
<p>But if you watch if you watch star wars speech right I think that was his way when he was like crying in tears and saying.</p>
<p>Been so hard we've had so many voices to listen to we didn't know who to listen to you know we've been you know a lot of them have been very negative and they've been there been trying to sort of understand you know whose voice and should we listen to the problem with the engine as well as it has so many players you have no idea i'll probably get scammers they get so much feedback that imagine trying to sift through that and understand what you're supposed to listen to so let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Are right which is a big massive skyscraper that has 60 departments.</p>
<p>And they asked all the billions of customers what they would like in their next product and you have company b who is like mom and pop shop who have regular zoo come in every couple of weeks who also want to ask what products that customers want which company do you think can get a better grasp of what their customers want and how to satisfy their customers needs out of those two companies.</p>
<p>Obviously the mom and pop shop right.</p>
<p>What word did will give a lot of stuff to get you in the door right another issue I have with words it advertises itself of this as this fun this fun whimsical game with with characters like on car and varina and it tries to appeal to the genshin market but when you play the game it's anything but that.</p>
<p>It's serious it takes itself serious it's a very.</p>
<p>Still edits very.</p>
<p>Capture this market.</p>
<p>And we'll see we'll see all the time if i'm right or not.</p>
<p>I think it's not trying to.</p>
<p>Tell I can't I can't I can't say what weathering waves is as a game because I don't think it knows what it is itself.</p>
<p>And I think they're really struggling to get the wrong identity as a game I think they're just they see something in genshin and they say oh genshin's got a pie on let's have an abbey and then they tack on an abbey but abby wasn't part of the game which is why it lives in the hand and it it just appears whenever it feels like it and it feels completely disconnected from the story and the same way all the characters feel disconnected from the story they don't actually make any difference to the overall world you could remove half the characters in that game and it wouldn't make any difference to the overall game or the overall experience because they don't play any significant part in the story itself.</p>
<p>Where's if you ripped.</p>
<p>Are genshin found its identity pretty quickly I think.</p>
<p>No I think I think I think what took time is genshin how to change what it was that's why so when genshin first was developed it was meant to be a honkai impact 3rd.</p>
<p>Like breath of the wild exploration game for honkai impact 3rd players right.</p>
<p>So they weren't they weren't planning on selling it to noobs and casuals because you know covid made that happen so when when the game went from being a sweaty honkai impact 3rd which is what it was originally going to be I mean that's why the game has you know everything was pointing towards it being you know lots of how difficult endgame and lovely characters to 90 and oh constellations in five star weapons to be another honkai impact 3rd basically but breath of the wild version but then covid happened and the audience drastically changed for the scam from what from what it was supposed to be so they looked at the numbers and they noticed that like not many players were engaging with spiral the best so they're original plan for this game which was going to be like spiral of the best you know the best end game sweaty content that were like well.</p>
<p>Not because you know will be will be leaving out 99% of our players you know if we make this game the thing that we're originally going to make it into all these new fresh covid people are now playing the game who are very casual they're going to leave the game because that's not what they're looking for so they had to adapt this game and shape it and satisfy what the audience wanted looking at the analytics so I think that's what they struggled with was reshaping the game to be a lot more casual than it was originally meant to be I don't think it's ever really struggled with its identity then you exactly what they've been doing they've got the they've had the whole the whole story is being planned out there's a trailer you can watch before genshin came out that is isn't even we're not even up to the point where the trailer was hitting up that we get up to they've had the whole story and I didn't even scammed out.</p>
<p>What's a change was the the target demographic for the player type it had to go from being a hardcore sweaty spiral the best type game to a much more casual like you know new friendly game and yeah that's a difficult thing to do right cuz you started building the game one way and i've got a transform into something else and I think that's the thing they struggled with a little bit was like oh shit this isn't.</p>
<p>Do really.</p>
<p>Giving how drastic a change that is.</p>
<p>What's the right balance for people.</p>
<p>Person in the game that they're satisfying you got to look at the overall you know.</p>
<p>And consider them as well.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what wuthering where does demographic is cos i'm still confused about it.</p>
<p>Is on one hand the game is easier than genshin.</p>
<p>And but then they have the projections right.</p>
<p>It's just it's just some of the negative things that a lot of people say about the scam I just think I think that I just think it's alright wrong it's just weird and especially when cos a lot of people will point at war and say oh we was doing things so much better and every time I play war I think what are you talking about will has the same problems but that's 10 times was.</p>
<p>And I just I just don't understand why does this weird misconception about it.</p>
<p>But yeah I mean i'm not trying to be.</p>
<p>Confused about does anybody know where the war was going to be telling for like sweaty end game cos obviously they made punishing grey raven didn't they before they made all their own words so the question was always ok is wuthering away it's going to be like punishing grey raven is it going to be for hardcore players are they going after the casual market and I think the answer is no I can't know but this is from what i've seen the answer is I don't think they know.</p>
<p>He's I think he's what where I think the issue is wuthering worse.</p>
<p>Is they make a character like on car they make abbey they market it for casuals and they want a piece of the genshin market so they've dressed it up as a more casual game but when you go into the game like I don't know it's I think it's trying to please both ends of the spectrum and by doing that they're not going to please anybody that's the worry right as if you if you want to invest in more than words I think.</p>
<p>Raven tapes but then also the casuals I think are going to feel left out.</p>
<p>Yeah I work I worry about like.</p>
<p>Who is longevity because it.</p>
<p>So I think they need to find figure out who their audiences who their purpose is an entirely tell it to them.</p>
<p>Cos I don't know myself i'm genuinely asking like I don't know is it casual or is it going for a more punishing grey raven type thing it's hard to tell because at the moment the game lucks anything substantial for either end like we don't get many events for casuals or anything.</p>
<p>Shop management thing.</p>
<p>You think they're going straight again.</p>
<p>Yeah it does seem that's what I think as well ok so then then my biggest concern for them is I think they should stop lying to their audience.</p>
<p>Let me show you something.</p>
<p>Have you seen the did you see the trailer that they released for what's the new character called.</p>
<p>Where is she.</p>
<p>Okay I watch this trail here so what we'll just watch this trailer for a second right and you tell me without the sound.</p>
<p>I think I agree with you then the question is why is the trailer advertising a different game.</p>
<p>Double speed.</p>
<p>Where was this the one I was thinking of.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ok when I watch this trailer if I if I wasn't playing this game and I watch this trailer.</p>
<p>Is stephanie better than what they've had in the past year it's definitely an improvement.</p>
<p>You know the one where they're arguing we even even this one.</p>
<p>It was the trailer for her but anyway the end of the day if you look at the where am I being this one.</p>
<p>Yeah this this one ok so.</p>
<p>Yeah so the problem is if I watch this trailer and I wasn't playing this game.</p>
<p>Could be expecting a very quirky very funny you know fun casual game.</p>
<p>If you look at the where these interactions are between the characters it's very you know it's very slapstick it's very silly it's very you know fun casual.</p>
<p>Comedy type stuff right.</p>
<p>And that so this game is kind of.</p>
<p>Rainy to appeal to a specific player type right by making it's trailer like this I just feel like when you're in the game itself.</p>
<p>Should the trailer does nothing to convey that.</p>
<p>Did you see what I mean the advertising a different game and they need to be careful about that because they're going to end up with the casuals coming in which is I think what they're trying to do they're going to end up with genshin players who are casual coming into the game and they're going to be like.</p>
<p>Is kim's boring you know what I mean where's where's my where's my pet cutting where's my cat fitting right they're going to be like where's my cat petting where's my pets.</p>
<p>Where's my you know.</p>
<p>My finch ball.</p>
<p>Yeah that's fine just like obviously everybody likes different types of games right some people like horror some people like romance some people like naughty games there's so many games out there different strokes with different fox and i'm all about that but I think you know that's marketing 101 is you've got a you've got to sort of know who your audience is and the market for the audience because if you're a dark sweaty player I think you see that trailer and you think that looks crap.</p>
<p>What's the mighty enjoyed the game.</p>
<p>I think we're bigger sort of you know more.</p>
<p>Certain type of game with a certain theme and you know they and they those do seem like opposite ends of the spectrum write like dark souls players and.</p>
<p>Stardew valley players.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who do you like both dark souls and stardew valley but there's less crossover than you know.</p>
<p>Then most of the jonas they are pretty much opposite ends of the scale at me so I think that's the that's the biggest issue they I think need to need to address any they need to sort of figure out who were they actually making the game for and tag it the game toward.</p>
<p>Nlb then i'll be sitting pretty.</p>
<p>Do you know I feel like the games got some kind of identity confusion it doesn't know what it is.</p>
<p>I don't think we do yet I don't I would guess that it would be the shower look like guy.</p>
<p>But I don't think it's confirmed.</p>
<p>She's not even announced yet.</p>
<p>Start this patch.</p>
<p>What is she supposed to be second no she's not second half is she.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Oh really.</p>
<p>What isn't this the first half.</p>
<p>Casa hearns milani.</p>
<p>Is it going to be three banners.</p>
<p>I'm getting confused.</p>
<p>Yeah I have no idea I don't look that far ahead.</p>
<p>I'm always panicking for the next patch.</p>
<p>And nothing's official anyway is it until until they do the live stream everything's kind of leeks at that.</p>
<p>And I remember so the only time I ever looked at leeks was when I was desperate to get my siege win because it's I was waiting forever for season to come out and saw it was when she already came out.</p>
<p>When she already came out all the leaks said it was going to be siege win and I was already I had so much saved up and I was so disappointed when it wasn't siege win so I was like ok i'm never looking at leeks again because it just freaking ruined my patch.</p>
<p>Was she only drip market had just before she came out then i.</p>
<p>I only watch the live streams and I watch some content creators.</p>
<p>Play the game and that's about it.</p>
<p>But yeah I mean I hope we're doing with.</p>
<p>What's better.</p>
<p>But I was I was kind of hoping for something a bit more like genshin because it was always I feel like they were going after the same audience you know I thought they were just going to make their own version of a genshin but I think it's going to be a lot more like punishing grey raven from the looks about.</p>
<p>I'll keep with it for now though.</p>
<p>I want to get the new healer.</p>
<p>Exploration is like my favourite thing to do in games.</p>
<p>Disney healer I think she's called like sharky or something.</p>
<p>She looks a bit like black swan from starwell.</p>
<p>Alright nice.</p>
<p>Waves was for me personally.</p>
<p>So there was one time in wuthering wales when I was like.</p>
<p>Okay i'm hyped i'm.</p>
<p>I'm having so much fun right now.</p>
<p>Do you remember when we got this quest where there was.</p>
<p>I love black swan as well actually.</p>
<p>Do you remember when there was like a tower defence in the middle of the swamp and they had some enemies up on a ledge and then there was the tower defense in the middle and these mud piles would appear and we got this gadget for washing mud off an enemy enemies would come and attack the thing we had to clear the mod off the thing clear the more off the enemies and then beat the enemies I loved that because for me that was a fresh take on the tower defence formula and I was like oh wow we've got like an like they've added an extra layer of like you know mechanics to the tower defense and it's i'm loving it it's fun and yet that's the only time we've ever had anything like that I love that.</p>
<p>I want more stuff like that I want more like unique stuff that's like ok you know let's I don't know if that was just fun for me I loved it.</p>
<p>And that was the most unique thing i've seen in the game as well.</p>
<p>Everything else I feel like i've played it in a different game you know but i've never played that before so that's why I was enjoying it so much I was like oh something new this is fun.</p>
<p>Tons of fun with that.</p>
<p>Which is fine but you know.</p>
<p>Unique about it.</p>
<p>Environmental you know mobs that have like unique old challenges to them that would I would love it.</p>
<p>I don't suppose we've got a.</p>
<p>Do I have all the teleporters yet.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>But I love uncle on car is my favourite thing about like him because again on cause unique and original i've never seen a girl fight with.</p>
<p>With plushie woolies before and I think it's freaking hilarious I love it I love on car and the thing about encourage you can show me a picture of on car and instantly I know that's wuthering words i'm like yep she saw identifiable she's such a great mascot character she immediately she's just stands out compared to all the characters from other games but I feel like the other characters all look like you know.</p>
<p>What are the characters if that makes sense so basically.</p>
<p>Princess girl just looks like a sharky but just looks like black swan you know the red head.</p>
<p>Slam girl she just looks like I don't know some generic big boob you know mummy wafer like there's nothing really that distinctive about them.</p>
<p>I want silly fun characters that do silly things and you know have fun with the game but I just I don't think it's going in that direction but then it makes me mad because then i'm like well why is on car in the game like if this isn't a game that i'm talking shining.</p>
<p>What they're trying to do is they're trying to.</p>
<p>Attract the genshin players and then hope that they just you know adapt to their type of game but I think that's a bad risk if that's what they're doing.</p>
<p>Is kitchen on broadway.</p>
<p>I'm just i'm just a three star.</p>
<p>Maybe three stars means the best in in career or everyone's career.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know I just I wonder why abby why on car why the silly quirky trailers.</p>
<p>And one possible reason is there trying to bet casuals into their game and then hope they'll adapt to a more sweaty dark sinister game or whatever but I think that is a huge risk.</p>
<p>Set light falsely advertised to a different demographic in the hopes that they'll just convert that's like.</p>
<p>Probably not an effective strategy.</p>
<p>Or maybe they're confused themselves about who their audiences that they're trying to target which is probably even more worrying because you kind of need to know that before you start marketing and you know making you game.</p>
<p>I don't know but i.</p>
<p>I guess time will tell right.</p>
<p>You know we'll try we'll throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.</p>
<p>Try target both demographics and.</p>
<p>Yeah good lots of them.</p>
<p>I need an animal character for last.</p>
<p>Why game why.</p>
<p>Why you do this to me.</p>
<p>Call now.</p>
<p>There's another one in there.</p>
<p>Play i'm sorry.</p>
<p>Is probably not wearing any gear he's probably naked right now naked vinny.</p>
<p>Why did I say that.</p>
<p>Screenshot.</p>
<p>Actually start making some progress.</p>
<p>So far i'm just.</p>
<p>Having way too much fun just exploring.</p>
<p>Randomly.</p>
<p>I haven't started it yet.</p>
<p>Haven't started i've been having too much fun this is what I always do.</p>
<p>Well first of all I like to explore anywhere.</p>
<p>I like to sort of get a good a good feel for the map before I get into it.</p>
<p>But secondly because I got cucina and melanie I needed to farm mats for them so i've been farming months as well.</p>
<p>Somewhat built.</p>
<p>Can I ask me a scene.</p>
<p>Actually I think.</p>
<p>She does have some weird mechanic I think I swear i've glided across a cliff before and she's gotten straight back into a drill when she landed on the cliff.</p>
<p>I need to test this now.</p>
<p>Maybe you've got a fall first and then glide.</p>
<p>Yes ok right you got to do that in the right order interesting ok so if you don't jump and glide check this out.</p>
<p>I've got 5 second cooldown away so basically when she's in a drill right normally when I glide I jump and glide right which is what I did the first time from my drill now if you do that you grab the rock as the character.</p>
<p>If you don't jump and you start to fall in your drill.</p>
<p>And then you glide you'll get straight back into the drill.</p>
<p>But then it didn't do it there and I was like.</p>
<p>If you want to grab the other end as the character jump first.</p>
<p>Whether it's supposed to do that but currently that's how it works.</p>
<p>Good morning yourself.</p>
<p>I could just.</p>
<p>Possess him.</p>
<p>And then it would give me the chest.</p>
<p>Best of souls at the bottom now.</p>
<p>Ok nice.</p>
<p>You've got to be.</p>
<p>Delicious.</p>
<p>I can answer that but I obviously I imagine i've got to kill him first.</p>
<p>I would guess.</p>
<p>Actually not you can enter there in the middle of battle which is kind of weird.</p>
<p>Cos I don't want him to reset.</p>
<p>By getting too far away from his spawn point because we all know that can happen.</p>
<p>Yes sometimes I like to snort them.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>Don't do that.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>I need a blue and from walter white though.</p>
<p>Over there.</p>
<p>Trying to figure out my best way up.</p>
<p>I haven't got any flood a lot flog a log right now.</p>
<p>I want to see a flog a log charging station around area.</p>
<p>You're an expert at thieving.</p>
<p>Yeah it's kind of weird as well how she uses her own energy and then burns flog a log.</p>
<p>Put melanie.</p>
<p>I know she doesn't.</p>
<p>That's what she was doing on the water though I still don't fully understand this.</p>
<p>I feel discrepancies oh shit i.</p>
<p>That was the opposite of what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>What do you need mechanical parts for sage room what are you building.</p>
<p>But what's interesting is you manipulates so far she's only manipulated people for like the overall good.</p>
<p>But she does she does manipulate people.</p>
<p>But then you find out that she actually was manipulating you but it's you know you also benefit from.</p>
<p>Energy.</p>
<p>Let's find out this is so fun.</p>
<p>Kill him now kill him later.</p>
<p>I guess we're killing him now aren't we.</p>
<p>Have you I don't think I would have survived not long without you.</p>
<p>Thus far.</p>
<p>I would not have survived.</p>
<p>It's kind of a.</p>
<p>Make the most of the new characters team you know.</p>
<p>Well functioning team as a team.</p>
<p>No mr dinosaur.</p>
<p>I'm off i'm off to the next teleporter which is just up this rock I believe.</p>
<p>What's need do not need a rice pudding please it takes so long actually the first ones fine right because the first ones not cool down so one race putting is fine but if it takes two rice puddings oh my god.</p>
<p>We can probably boost actually.</p>
<p>What's 1 mile this is another two more.</p>
<p>Which one first.</p>
<p>I feel like if a glide down to this level in england.</p>
<p>That's the plan.</p>
<p>Look at this region.</p>
<p>Nope you love.</p>
<p>Another shrine of the depths.</p>
<p>Have the keys.</p>
<p>Very very much.</p>
<p>Ok we can't open it.</p>
<p>Alarm up.</p>
<p>Final teleporter where are you I was right we can glide over i.</p>
<p>You know you were saying you're an expert katrina I am an.</p>
<p>Where is it.</p>
<p>Where do you go.</p>
<p>Can I hit giraffe in the face i'm sorry mr giraffe.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>How did I miss.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>Oh that's it you now there's two of them after me why are you doing this to me.</p>
<p>Do you not see.</p>
<p>Is about the animal slimes.</p>
<p>How am I so bad at this.</p>
<p>How.</p>
<p>What are you mechanically making though that's the question.</p>
<p>Okay so because we fell.</p>
<p>Now we'll get back straight back in our drill if we land on a rock.</p>
<p>I love that.</p>
<p>Where are you taking me.</p>
<p>That was not part of the plan.</p>
<p>Exploding.</p>
<p>Blue things.</p>
<p>I don't see all this one.</p>
<p>Hi it's one more.</p>
<p>One more.</p>
<p>Phone never stops.</p>
<p>Another new enemies hype.</p>
<p>Get back in my drill.</p>
<p>Call me jack going up the hill.</p>
<p>We've got another shrine of the dance.</p>
<p>And the teleporter.</p>
<p>Take the camera off me.</p>
<p>Oh my god you bastards you fucking bastards you literally killed my cucina I can't believe how long that stupid camera locked me out for while i'm being attacked.</p>
<p>Bastards.</p>
<p>You little shit bag.</p>
<p>Are piss off.</p>
<p>And also the the wind things gone now so I guess I had a limited time to do it and yeah well I was kind of in the middle of being murdered in cold blood sorry where's my player oculus.</p>
<p>No bad dinosaur stop it.</p>
<p>I thought the villages in the sirens lived in peace together that's what the trailer said we've been lied to this whole time.</p>

<p>My dad said yeah fall off the cliffhill.</p>
<p>What is this thing out right.</p>

<p>Because whoever that was official has a.</p>
<p>I don't like that because that now it's like.</p>
<p>So i'd rather not get that buff and have them all come back at the same time to be.</p>
<p>Inconsistent like.</p>
<p>Well in this case.</p>
<p>Why don't I just jump down.</p>

<p>Karina.</p>
<p>Make a sound of a wave rider here.</p>
<p>Is there a river here.</p>
<p>321 let's go.</p>
<p>I want to be better off i'm sorry for either I should have brought you with me.</p>
<p>What kind of surfer girl drowns not a very good one.</p>
<p>I'm regretting all of my life choices right now I really want to go there physically though but like.</p>
<p>Of 52 bowls of rice pudding.</p>
<p>With only one bowl of rice pudding.</p>
<p>We're only halfway through the current stamina bar but also a race pudding doesn't give you a full bar.</p>
<p>I don't know they could have at least give me a wave rider or something.</p>
<p>You know.</p>
<p>I thought I could just teleport.</p>
<p>Ok i'm convinced that with a bowl of rice pudding we can make it to the speech.</p>
<p>But i'm wrong.</p>
<p>Teleporting.</p>
<p>Where's my rose playing.</p>
<p>We can make it a speech.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>Unbearable.</p>
<p>So cucina.</p>
<p>You can use your mum for now.</p>
<p>Can you switch characters while hanging on a cliff let me test that can you switch characters while.</p>
<p>Left.</p>
<p>No so you can't.</p>
<p>What's the net between cucina and carrara well you wouldn't be able to anyway because you can't pop the.</p>
<p>Hang on a cliff either.</p>
<p>Shot cool down slightly I guess.</p>
<p>I just wish these skills had a bit longer on them.</p>
<p>Yeah we have to get up.</p>
<p>Even if you kept your settings to sam.</p>
<p>You're so good.</p>
<p>And settings go higher than this as well they're just.</p>
<p>Skip them on hi instead of ultron.</p>
<p>Platforms at once and that takes a little bit of.</p>
<p>What is the smoothest socks off.</p>
<p>2500 metres away.</p>
<p>Can you get out this weather.</p>
<p>Turn the heating get out this way.</p>
<p>Can I i can't get on that can i.</p>
<p>Didn't get up.</p>
<p>Yeah it seems it definitely handles.</p>
<p>Ok you don't need to talk to you drill.</p>
<p>Tell me about.</p>
<p>Yeah ok so you can see like the.</p>
<p>Square rocks through the fog even from like from here.</p>
<p>Watch my stamina that.</p>
<p>Nothing over there.</p>
<p>Limits of the map first.</p>
<p>I couldn't even use melanie's.</p>
<p>I know you're a full charge.</p>
<p>Get my red flowers.</p>
<p>Yeah so if you are in it between milani and cucina.</p>
<p>You can actually have most up time.</p>
<p>I'll be honest you know this new particle effect that goes around the outline the edge of the character.</p>
<p>That was so excited to announce.</p>
<p>I don't think it looks very good.</p>
<p>Because it looks like.</p>
<p>Has cucina got it now.</p>
<p>I think it's melanie's that looks like that that's also probably because of a designer design looks very.</p>
<p>Where's the tomato and cheese.</p>
<p>Pen outline.</p>
<p>Effects.</p>
<p>Play steep cliff to clim.</p>
<p>What about a quarter pound saw.</p>
<p>Skip this one.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>Dispatch might be a problem.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>So the last like 1000 m.</p>
<p>You weirdo.</p>
<p>Yeah the last 1000 m was.</p>
<p>Yeah I also feel like melanie's.</p>
<p>Left side stomach depletes slower of just being in the on region itself.</p>
<p>Fontana right and she just.</p>
<p>It's just a little bit weird.</p>
<p>The day.</p>
<p>For me I think.</p>
<p>Change it to one of two things.</p>
<p>If they seen you off at the dock like they did which makes sense then I don't know stick away ryder I just make it so you went up with a ball and then you know quick little.</p>
<p>Play for now you kind of glided on over the front end.</p>
<p>Goodbye at the top of a cliff with the sort of expectation that you just going to glide on over to that one.</p>
<p>The phone.</p>
<p>As he signs of human habitation let's try heading this way.</p>
<p>Experiences using the door by that should be the case.</p>
<p>I could have the deepest connection to their respective nations.</p>
<p>Welcome back.</p>
<p>I am a 7 million of these grand fruits by.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Crystal beetle.</p>
<p>Go deeper into nutland.</p>
<p>You are just a small toddler.</p>
<p>Chrome.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you know uncle mojuba juber boo boo pick me.</p>
<p>As if like she'd been selected to to go up against the you know for the tournament but now it looks like it's the opposite she's the only one who can't take part.</p>
<p>Scooby-doo.</p>
<p>Who's a bt.</p>
<p>You do look pretty ancient.</p>
<p>Sounds like some kind of nutland national games.</p>
<p>I'm just so hamster taking part of speech of.</p>
<p>What's your plan now.</p>
<p>Sorry I was so we gonna are there baby quite cool actually are we going to become her team and she's going to be our captain oh that could be cool.</p>
<p>How I can be cool.</p>
<p>Yeah basically.</p>
<p>I wasn't thinking about any of that actually you run a tough spot and I wanted to help.</p>
<p>That's fine with us but what about your competition.</p>
<p>When you see how much pain on each.</p>
<p>Expert is playing.</p>
<p>When there are 1234 or more opponents within turbo dual field.</p>
<p>Gans increase defence yes.</p>
<p>Everybody in the field oh that's good so defensible for everybody.</p>
<p>That sounds good the quest location is what.</p>
<p>The location is involved in a quest.</p>
<p>How can a location be involved.</p>
<p>Graffiti visionary please complete it first.</p>
<p>Ok this one.</p>
<p>Turn off.</p>
<p>Set.</p>
<p>Ariana grande.</p>
<p>Give me a.</p>
<p>Star glitter star dust whatever it is.</p>
<p>Wow does it turns out the children of course you can dance pam I never thought the human body I didn't get out of that the rhythmic music the exciting fireworks all of the combined brings it totally different vibe from anything we've seen so far.</p>
<p>Distinguished two yes i'm sure you have what it takes to be the vanguard of avant-garde and i'm rising star mong graffiti artists.</p>
<p>Allegations.</p>
<p>The frenetic music the vivid graffiti.</p>
<p>Being deep with connections to the alan guard.</p>
<p>Fashions trends novelty to us these are synonyms.</p>
<p>Turn on avant-garde.</p>
<p>That way I will constantly evolve and works of extraordinary aesthetic value may be produced ever upwards and on the large scale graffiti work.</p>
<p>Am I specific example then.</p>
<p>See the large work of graffiti in a stage backdrop I was involved in drawing that.</p>
<p>Is that backdrop was a realistic landscape painting a fine oil painting from fontaine or a mural from samaro.</p>
<p>Do you think it would still fit.</p>
<p>Patterns and colours weren't as explosive it would feel less energetic.</p>
<p>If you ask me every tribe and nutland has the impulse to drive ever higher the desire to pursue strength that's why I haven't got is our primary primary style.</p>
<p>You know you call yourself derby but you're pretty knowledgeable aren't you I need to take us on the students what charlie rose.</p>
<p>How about fortune of him either what we do here is share our experiences.</p>
<p>And then you can help me with sketches me sketches you could also help me promote this on elsewhere on a track my talent to our alliance after all our goal is to create unparalleled avantgard work in every mountain currently though we number it just over 10 people and that's just not going to hack it.</p>
<p>Monsters and buddies.</p>
<p>Yes that's the spirit in that case let's get to it now our work isn't too strict about painting skills it's all about the mindset let us begin therefore by taking the measure of avangard the measure you mean the principles.</p>
<p>That's enough in short we need.</p>
<p>Challenge and discover the limits of human movement and the midst of close quarter combat just as I do.</p>
<p>We make use of combinations found in the natural world so you'll be surprised just how many surprises it has in store.</p>
<p>Is methods of studying aesthetics radio kind of different.</p>
<p>Yes I think it is.</p>
<p>It's the events.</p>
<p>Apparently I already.</p>
<p>Trade the gold flame.</p>
<p>Shield to make it fall.</p>
<p>And I already got this this and this so i've somewhat completed the event.</p>
<p>Beautiful beautiful.</p>
<p>Can you completed.</p>
<p>I complete that one.</p>
<p>And I completed that one.</p>
<p>I'm so good I completed without even trying without even knowing what the hell i'm doing amazing.</p>
<p>Jack russell not so amazing.</p>
<p>Not so amazing at all.</p>
<p>It said I had to to move on with the quest.</p>
<p>Achievement.</p>
<p>Play dance dance.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>What's the drill bit dance at the children of echoes.</p>
<p>Ok so back to the quest.</p>
<p>We can't be.</p>
<p>We can't be cucina following cucina it's just too jarring.</p>
<p>Slow down kid.</p>
<p>It's like our marcus.</p>
<p>Can we related.</p>
<p>Is our marcus I told you to make friends.</p>
<p>Yes no.</p>
<p>No illegal back room gambling.</p>
<p>No selling and creating bitcoins.</p>
<p>Nice rock.</p>
<p>We'll see you too.</p>
<p>American tv at woman.</p>
<p>Stay away from the.</p>
<p>That voice does not match that character.</p>
<p>See that should be like some.</p>
<p>Dining room.</p>
<p>Girls like a bad guy in danganronpa with like long blonde hair and he's a bit of a psycho that would be like how it sounded he was saying.</p>
<p>It's a vatican sir and I get it.</p>
<p>Basically.</p>
<p>Don't show him last no.</p>
<p>Why should he get to look at our adventure handbook why should we trust him what's all this he doesn't trust us why should we trust him.</p>
<p>Can a mixed bag let me think.</p>
<p>How long to be honest there yeah they're not all.</p>
<p>Focus mode i'm trying to think what.</p>
<p>I think you can.</p>
<p>You know when all the quests get tied up with other quests I think it just kind of like make sure nothing interferes with that quest that you're you're in so basically ok.</p>
<p>The way I think it works.</p>
<p>Is if you were doing what used to happen is if you were.</p>
<p>You were focused on a quest.</p>
<p>Are you left a bunch of quests around the area that hadn't been picked up you would walk and they would activate so by focus mode you can focus on that quest and you can walk past them and they want activate basically.</p>
<p>So you can just focus on that one quest.</p>
<p>On now is excited now lenny's.</p>
<p>It's alright can we get a.</p>
<p>So why do people inherit ancient names.</p>
<p>Looks like a feather.</p>
<p>Indeed boo indeed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interjection.</p>
<p>So you can you can still do the old stories.</p>
<p>Yeah that's good because it's bad enough that you can't replay them once they are done to be honest.</p>
<p>I just got started to be honest we just got here so it's a little early but yeah I mean you know so far it's fine but it's just warming up.</p>
<p>Are you i'm a bit disappointed that we can't be on team cucina that would have been good I want you can find a way around it.</p>
<p>I would like that.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Sounds like a form of mental fortitude.</p>
<p>Not even celestia itself.</p>
<p>It's a placebo storm.</p>
<p>You just have to put it up your bum.</p>
<p>I don't know I don't know i'm stupid.</p>
<p>Freedom wishes of wishes phone.</p>
<p>I'm not really needing anything right now.</p>
<p>Most of the way you know it might the second one might come at about 70 so I was already I was already 20 in at sea was probably about 17.</p>
<p>160.</p>
<p>160 + 49.</p>
<p>Implicitly.</p>
<p>Implicitly instantly trusted as soon as they find out where we are now who we are now.</p>
<p>You are the hero after all.</p>
<p>You're a very considerate person.</p>
<p>What's the weather like in cromwells but I was saying normally overall I probably have I probably have better look at the most.</p>
<p>And if I wanted if I wanted to be patient and just see if I got her anywhere that would that would have been a sensible thing but yeah I just really wanted to like you know really really get in another one and try everything new and.</p>
<p>Overall i'm preferring cucina to.</p>
<p>Get over the initial disappointment.</p>
<p>Where the hell was that.</p>
<p>Play rock and I just saw play rock this around here.</p>
<p>Plant.</p>
<p>And I wouldn't normally but.</p>
<p>I made an exception this time just cause i'm home for not alone and it's been so long since the last day and it'll be fine.</p>
<p>What is she doing now she's looking at a rock I always thought she was eating some like coloured candy or something.</p>
<p>But she's looking at that rock isn't she.</p>
<p>Twitch drops done.</p>
<p>Twitch drops down.</p>
<p>It's always worked out before.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Is the volume 2.0.</p>
<p>The valley in the seconds.</p>
<p>Do allans drunk uncle.</p>
<p>Remind me about italian monster.</p>
<p>That's very generous of you.</p>
<p>Turn mascot characters in she.</p>
<p>She's cool really good.</p>
<p>Play bubbly.</p>
<p>And the floors true farm challenges within children of echoes territory you must collect as many challenge coins and orbs.</p>
<p>What is fresh as possible within a time limit I don't want to do that now.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>We should be able to offer.</p>
<p>Ok so level two.</p>
<p>Is the shower guy who obviously i'm skipping.</p>
<p>And then I think the one after that are one of the.</p>
<p>Well is rumoured to be the lion girl actually even though I love that character and she's like war will see right.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>I think functionally she's not good she's basically just going to be a five-star casino.</p>
<p>Who looks a bit like him a car.</p>
<p>So out of out of the four even though I love the lioness as a character like visually I think she loves.</p>
<p>So we'll just stick with chibi chibi lying on bunny or whatever she is over lioness girl and I think i'll skip line ass cos that can always pick her up during the rear run because I only really wanna cos I think she's hot.</p>
<p>Well it depends on the game.</p>
<p>If I skipped her then that gives me plenty of time to say for the next character.</p>
<p>Healer.</p>
<p>I always have a healer.</p>
<p>Right so.</p>
<p>For an atlant team I probably just need one more character now.</p>
<p>I don't think a c1.</p>
<p>Why do I just keep getting fucking weapons weapons bennetts and jeans that's all I get on here weapons benetton jeans.</p>
<p>Yeah melania c1 might not be too bad I don't know if I would get her but like that's that would be the worst outcome from.</p>
<p>Oh I see that's this.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't want to do that right now.</p>
<p>Yeah so if the worst outcome from continuing to pull on her banner is her at c1 that wouldn't be too bad.</p>
<p>That I couldn't get melanie anywhere because really did I need siege when it's c1 no.</p>
<p>Dear are the sword.</p>
<p>You say that as if you use your stomach to see your clamor is still a sword come on.</p>
<p>Oh my god finally a character.</p>
<p>Okay kitchens best girl.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>She's like a girl scout.</p>
<p>Just thinking about what happened with the statue of the seven.</p>
<p>How I get it.</p>
<p>Different owl.</p>
<p>Time on.</p>
<p>Are human ascending to the divine throne that's kind of like what farina did but.</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean by chilled.</p>
<p>But dude I played this game since it came out it's never been hard.</p>
<p>I think I think the game is totally free to play for friendly if you can clear all the content which you can with them with normal characters then it's free to her friendly which it is.</p>
<p>Nothing in this game is being that hard the heart I think the hardest thing a child the child wasn't that hard he is a lot harder than he is now.</p>
<p>Yeah it's ridiculously easy now.</p>
<p>Ridiculously easy.</p>
<p>The unskilled.</p>
<p>But it's never been hard come on.</p>
<p>Nerf them because a lot of you know.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>The news you don't play anything other than genshin you know i'm going to struggle with stuff like that so I get it.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know you might struggle on mobile it's probably a lot harder to play this on mobile and it is with a control.</p>
<p>I said depends on how she feels about us.</p>
<p>Let me give it a try.</p>
<p>I want better now.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be honest.</p>
<p>Play do the last one.</p>
<p>Someone's not happy.</p>
<p>How bigfoot.</p>
<p>Don't mind if we do.</p>
<p>Are you scared of you can fly.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>And they've got any other way right they could have put stamina in the underwater or breathe underwater but they didn't they saw.</p>
<p>Because they put it in tower fantasy as well didn't they.</p>
<p>It's awful entire fantasy did you play the cold areas in tara fantasy.</p>
<p>Where they copied that.</p>
<p>Gamers do not like freezing cold mechanics.</p>
<p>So i'll be surprised if they.</p>
<p>Sounds like you further had to me so don't spoil anything.</p>
<p>I haven't noticed.</p>
<p>Like that song.</p>
<p>I've got an unlocked all the statues i've been everywhere is to go not everywhere but.</p>
<p>That's energy that you that you use for special skills.</p>
<p>I'm here to win it.</p>
<p>Which was.</p>
<p>Where the.</p>
<p>Where the teammates.</p>
<p>Is there a lava section.</p>
<p>Do you like lava cos it's volcanic right now obviously the the lava you can only stay on it for so long on your burn alive basically that might be what you think of.</p>
<p>Decided to make it as casual as you can.</p>
<p>So it's like I think that just do that with a cryo nation because why would they.</p>
<p>I guess but if they die then you screwed on you cuz all your weakest people are left.</p>
<p>Is it dangerous though.</p>
<p>Such as water.</p>
<p>I don't know just enjoy the moment why you always looking ahead.</p>
<p>You're always talking about what's next.</p>
<p>You never anything that you're in.</p>
<p>Yeah that's why I got the bus.</p>
<p>Depends.</p>
<p>Things are definitely less lonely with time around it's nice having prime on by my side.</p>
<p>Appreciation scene.</p>
<p>But you're.</p>
<p>Like a half.</p>
<p>Are cucina just to ruin everything don't ruin this moment.</p>
<p>So what are we doing are we on at any team or what i'm lost.</p>
<p>Ask nice I like I like that they have a good like a good relationship.</p>
<p>Ok so register for the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>So i'm still confused what are we doing then or are we still on the team but then she was just concerned that there was going to be two ancient named barras.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of symbols on them.</p>
<p>You look so weird.</p>
<p>It's fine I understand the importance of this event.</p>
<p>Speak for yourself time on a headset and cut scenes too long.</p>
<p>Also like what's up with the.</p>
<p>What did you go to war with the nation that has the part that resurrects of it's dead.</p>
<p>It's not like a fools around.</p>
<p>Kind of a losing battle.</p>
<p>My camera is too colourful it was very bleach it looks very bleach this morning so I turned to saturation of a no.</p>
<p>Oh my god keyboard will you just wake up thank you.</p>
<p>Saturation is 80 let's try.</p>
<p>67.</p>
<p>I'm confused so.</p>
<p>Can you send five people in a bottle.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter cuz the other one can bring the other for back.</p>
<p>I'm confused I think so if they're saying i'm sucking views.</p>
<p>If there's sick because they say they send their best to worries.</p>
<p>I said you can only resurrect.</p>
<p>If you have somebody left alive.</p>
<p>In a team or whatever so like.</p>
<p>The thing i'm curious about is so is that is the pre-war tournament fight to the death.</p>
<p>Are they saying.</p>
<p>But when people perish it's because they failed war in which case they sent their best and their best failed I don't know i'm slightly confused.</p>
<p>I want to break from sitting in cutscenes though.</p>
<p>God's dammit.</p>
<p>Can I get out this way.</p>
<p>Frog.</p>
<p>So mark the shrine of the depths around this somewhere.</p>
<p>That's a big rock alright.</p>
<p>A big big rock.</p>
<p>How much is behind this one.</p>
<p>Where does.</p>
<p>China china doesn't have a problem with that.</p>
<p>So the last time the last time they did the censorship it was because competitors were stirring up their controversies online and so high I had to be seen to do something about it so what happens in china a lot is.</p>
<p>What is they don't have the same laws we have over here that's that's how they get away with plagiarism and stuff like that they are very dirty business practices in china so if a business one competitive businesses so probably someone like freaking.</p>
<p>10 cent.</p>
<p>Get a stick up the ass because they don't like the genshin's making so much money so they tried to hurt the business so they'll hire bahts to stir up fake controversy online.</p>
<p>What about censorship or whatever right that force the tries to like damage their reputation.</p>
<p>It's like evidence of it and stuff.</p>
<p>Put nobody really care about censorship.</p>
<p>So if I doubt the same people would would try again because it didn't work last time right.</p>
<p>Whoever decided to stir up the fat.</p>
<p>Tell me about censorship.</p>
<p>Because they don't they don't really care about that.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>How much better it's actually a little bit of a challenge now.</p>
<p>This is obviously meant to be a hard challenge.</p>
<p>Shut up you.</p>
<p>Are today fucking reset the reset over there I can't be asked for.</p>
<p>Is this to make it more challenging.</p>
<p>Do you want it to be my challenging.</p>
<p>And you can get slightly better rewards.</p>
<p>It's more for players like me you yeah.</p>
<p>Which is one shot everything right now so it's like yeah ok at least this makes it a bit more challenging.</p>
<p>Right yes I opened the shrine of the depths also it's melanie's.</p>
<p>Character book day so I might want a farm while I can yeah I do need those pretty badly actually.</p>
<p>I've got a new type of wood.</p>
<p>Convert word.</p>
<p>Are you not going to be going to world level 9 like.</p>
<p>Am I better hard for some of the not so well built teams even then it's still kind of casual friendly though.</p>
<p>Within reason.</p>
<p>So if it's too hard you can turn it down.</p>
<p>Which I think is fine.</p>
<p>You can still do not land.</p>
<p>You can still do all the content at world level 8 probably even 7.</p>
<p>I normally I like to play this game solo anyway so I don't I don't normally like.</p>
<p>Do much stuff in my world cup anyway really I think you'll be able to still do crop with me though.</p>
<p>This is no guarantee will end up you know match together that's the thing.</p>
<p>Is primarily a single play games not like terror fantasy terror fantasy was more.</p>
<p>Online focus wasn't that.</p>
<p>Play focus.</p>
<p>Can I get those whistles.</p>
<p>Sold out.</p>
<p>Yeah that's fine.</p>
<p>I don't normally caught with other people in my world anywhere.</p>
<p>Spotify ever do that.</p>
<p>Do I have a coke with people in my world not really.</p>
<p>Cos I like to play single player I like to clear it single I do all my domain single player I do all my farming in my own world single player anytime it's but I don't mind helping other people in their world's and then sometimes if you like desperate for resources you can go to somebody's world you know from their resources if you are all dried up.</p>
<p>I don't really do much carbon this game.</p>
<p>Yeah that's a stephanie harder though that's quite good but I mean you know what I mean i'm managing fine mamelani is 60.</p>
<p>My kitchen is 70 so they obviously when they're fully builds they still have law talents they don't have their actual proper weapons yet.</p>
<p>It's still really easy.</p>
<p>Breath of the wayfair.</p>
<p>You're still really easy on on this.</p>
<p>Oh that's a pretty.</p>
<p>Lousy drop.</p>
<p>Yes a lot easier now but even then it wasn't it wasn't so bad.</p>
<p>I probably did die to him but like you know.</p>
<p>You wouldn't like you wouldn't like zenith on zero then since.</p>
<p>Play sweaty competitors.</p>
<p>Yes it's completely different.</p>
<p>It would be like being allergic to peanuts and saying you know.</p>
<p>Should you take the peanuts out peanuts but you just don't eat peanuts if you're allergic to penis if you don't you know if you need to stay away from flush and you want to stay away from the flush and fast you know.</p>
<p>Terrify to see this wuthering.</p>
<p>Almost like a bullet hell version of a.</p>
<p>Yeah that happened actually so here in the uk that's actually a good example so this this shows like here in the uk we have these with these chocolate things called revels.</p>
<p>Little delight chocolate balls and they have various things inside.</p>
<p>So you get a pack of these chocolate balls and some of them will have honeycomb in the middle someone will have toffee in the middle some will have orange in the middle and they used to have ones with peanuts in the middle but I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess because they weren't implicitly listed as a peanut snack.</p>
<p>Turn on maybe somebody had a bad.</p>
<p>Action who is allergic to peanuts.</p>
<p>How are you nobody gets peanuts and it's like well.</p>
<p>Now I know it gets new ones because like if you know if you cook a dish that's handled if you cook in cookware that's handled nuts it can cause it an allergy in a reaction of someone who's allergic so like you know they already have to take a lot of precautions with that.</p>
<p>If you allergic to peanuts like you make sure that one of the in the surprise bag mix or whatever one of the things isn't a bloody peanut.</p>
<p>So you don't get out.</p>
<p>Otherwise you know.</p>
<p>I don't know it's just.</p>
<p>Designing things around edge cases is never a good idea.</p>
<p>What's a house sunglasses.</p>
<p>Fill out the uv light.</p>
<p>Do you like helps with that.</p>
<p>No you uv uv stands for ultraviolet.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet is in sunlight.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet is just a temperature so you know how colour has the temperature.</p>
<p>What's a red green blue is different temperature right ultraviolet can't be seen because it's outside of our field of view but it's just an extremely high temperature that's why it's called ultraviolet it's hotter than violets basically it's high frequency than violet.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 10 to 400 mm shorter than that of visible light but longer than x-rays so we can't see it pretty sure it's in the sun for humans sunshine and some burner similar familiar effects of exposure of the skin to uv light so sunlight has uv light in it.</p>
<p>Uv light produced by the sun.</p>
<p>Play earth would not be.</p>
<p>What's a life if most of that light was not filtered out by the atmosphere so uv light and it's raw form would kill us essentially.</p>
<p>But our atmosphere felt as most of it out before it reaches earth.</p>
<p>And that's what gives you sunburn it can give you skin cancer and it can cause other issues.</p>
<p>You can get fake uv lights that are like sun lamps but they're specifically made to to produce ultraviolet type light.</p>
<p>It's just a high frequency light that we can't see.</p>
<p>I'm kissing the pilgrimage hasn't gone too well in the past.</p>
<p>I just explained it I understand it I understand it perfectly.</p>
<p>Yeah most of it comes from the sun.</p>
<p>It sounds like.</p>
<p>There are a lot of there are a lot of snake oil salesman.</p>
<p>Tell us now you got to be careful cuz there's a lot of snake oil sales went out there so a lot of people say rice.</p>
<p>And this has been proven wrong by the way.</p>
<p>Ok so does extra blue light that comes from daylight because of the reflection of the sky right so in theory.</p>
<p>In theory.</p>
<p>Our the extra blue light is supposed to stimulate something in the brain that makes us feel more awake so because you can get a lot of blue light off screens let at night right people with theorizing that it would cause it it might cause it to be difficult to sleep if you spend too long screens to let at night because of the blue light coming from the screens right so then they started even windows has a blue light filter modern stuff right it's all bulshit by the way.</p>
<p>Thinking that you're filtering out those frequency lights from your screens that might be affecting you.</p>
<p>Again it's probably snake oil stuff the amount of uv you would get off a screen would be.</p>
<p>It's probably a almost a measurable so yeah it's the same as the blue light thing right.</p>
<p>In theory yes that is kind of how our brain responds to that but it's because there's so much of it outside that it's like you know it's triggering it because it's a massive amount screens just can't recreate that it all because that's just such a weak amount of light and it's sold on like weak by comparison but yeah any any light that's coming from the screen isn't going to be affecting you directly like that it'll be the it's the it's the sudden wrapping rapid motion that does it I believe from lfc we can look it up.</p>
<p>My friend had a.</p>
<p>Fancy rappers.</p>
<p>Rat brands servers are a good model apparently.</p>
<p>Vehicle.</p>
<p>Fun related.</p>
<p>I know like strawberries for the thing that used to set.</p>
<p>Effects from the tv and it's that kind of thing it's like the rapid on and off.</p>
<p>Flashing flickering that.</p>
<p>But yeah uv lights blue lights if you read anything about how that can be harmful to your eyes it's it's hardship the amount of light you get off the tv screen of a 16 screen every day and it slices and bother me at all.</p>
<p>Unbelievably we.</p>
<p>Anything like blue lights any of the frequencies that you get from it I just.</p>
<p>By comparison so even if any of those frequencies are bad for you.</p>
<p>Would be the daylight you need to worry about it coming from.</p>
<p>What's where most of our lights coming from right obviously the sun.</p>
<p>Buy a massive difference such a difference you wouldn't believe.</p>
<p>And obvious solution to a problem that might not even be the problem that you I mean you obviously have a real problem but you know there'll be no shortage of people who say I can solve that for a price.</p>
<p>Chemical imbalance in the brain.</p>
<p>These are just you know.</p>
<p>Don't let don't let it define you.</p>
<p>How to how to be safe against those triggers and things like that but yeah you can you can get to you know.</p>
<p>You can get sort of two in the rabbit hole and a lot of those rabbit holes that people will offer you often have a lot of misinformation and then stuff especially this day in and everybody wants to be an expert something that they don't know anything about.</p>
<p>So it's it's difficult though.</p>
<p>Just call us cheerleaders warning too.</p>
<p>Please don't.</p>
<p>Do an order.</p>
<p>Yes are we really.</p>
<p>So where's until 8:10 the next day look for cucina and melanie.</p>
<p>I'd like to.</p>
<p>Get the extra dialogue.</p>
<p>You know another another amazing thing about these guys get games as if they have a if they have an urgent bug that needs fixing.</p>
<p>And yeah I mean some players will complain that always with you know it took this long to get this thing and talk about to get that thing but that's because you know that's not.</p>
<p>I thought I could share some experience with you.</p>
<p>Help you do the best you can.</p>
<p>Manchester strength.</p>
<p>Studio opponent master they have its.</p>
<p>Achievements.</p>
<p>Danger can come out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Stay on your feet.</p>
<p>195.</p>
<p>I need to hide the character.</p>
<p>How do I move the camera.</p>
<p>Can you put a dinosaur in the background.</p>
<p>Should we find out.</p>
<p>Let's find out if you can stand on the heads.</p>
<p>Ok you can but you can't.</p>
<p>You kind of just stay hovering on it.</p>
<p>Is the stamina depleting now I don't think it is is that.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>I believe you.</p>
<p>Have a quick one.</p>
<p>Alright I think I will leave the cos I need to go get some food soon anyway.</p>
<p>And i'll pick this up again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Yes i'm going to go get some food anyway so i'll pick this up tomorrow I think.</p>
<p>I might just do a bit of farming.</p>
<p>Stream without.</p>
<p>Sending her but that's not time sensitive.</p>
<p>Oh that's a different type of whistle to that that's why.</p>
<p>Yeah so probably get some of these whilst it's this day then tomorrow is the weapon day for the signature weapons oh yes another good point actually i've been using that weapon on her so.</p>
<p>Sing little glimpses of her potential but like I don't know overall she still feels kind of man at the moment but she's she's not built so.</p>
<p>How are the invested.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's the weapon there.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Conquest.</p>
<p>Unlocked after unlocking natland tribe reputation I don't think i've done it yet yeah I need to finish this icon question first.</p>
<p>Yeah it seems like it seems good.</p>
<p>Considering you know what i'll tell you what as well.</p>
<p>This is the first region cos we always get like one.</p>
<p>Expand our thing.</p>
<p>Yeah what was the first air in fontana wasn't it this little one here.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>You're married to tara fantasy then I think.</p>
<p>I know you already left the stream by then as well I can't remember.</p>
<p>What was that a year ago.</p>
<p>I will leave it there for now.</p>
<p>Why didn't want to feel like I was rushed to do that.</p>
<p>Hello are you going to.</p>
<p>Indonesia these are for the events.</p>
<p>All right thanks for joining me see you next time.</p>
<p>Everything is falling down.</p>
<p>Are we good.</p>
<p>Make on.</p>
<p>Game off.</p>
<p>Camera out the frame.</p>
<p>Alarm.</p>
<p>Why does twitch say that add still running.</p>
<p>I had twitch.</p>
<p>I don't know whatever.</p>
<p>The award.</p>
<p>Where is it that one.</p>
<p>Games car ward.</p>
<p>Extra extra gifts.</p>
<p>Excited.</p>
<p>This game hate me I don't know why.</p>
<p>You know anything is i've watched a few content creators now.</p>
<p>So far won the 50/50.</p>
<p>I told you what happened everybody wins the 50.</p>
<p>Except for me.</p>
<p>Now I saw I win to lose.</p>
<p>Fail a couple but that's because he spent $2,000 and he was doing full after pull after pull to test the new banner.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>Because like it's like I don't know it's just that's how my look is right somebody could say they could have said ok for this character only right there's a 99% chance that you'll win.</p>
<p>And there's a 1% chance that you'll lose.</p>
<p>And I would have I would have hit that one said I guarantee it I don't know why that's just the way it works.</p>
<p>It just gave me every pilgrim.</p>
<p>The odds were like in.</p>
<p>Never play impossible and yet it happened.</p>
<p>So it works both ways.</p>
<p>I'm losing that.</p>
<p>Am I captain.</p>
<p>I didn't even log on again last night I was too busy.</p>
<p>We will be condensing that.</p>
<p>Is it more than 24 hours to fill the carpenter.</p>
<p>Cuz it's been.</p>
<p>Spend any resident in the scam.</p>
<p>And yeah it's only 140.</p>
<p>This realm will kick you in the ass.</p>
<p>Do we want to spend any of those kinds probably not oh my god i've got a headache.</p>
<p>We're back.</p>
<p>Make song makes on.</p>
<p>Ok so.</p>
<p>So we can dancing a resene.</p>
<p>We are indeed.</p>
<p>Ask us the second area opened up.</p>
<p>Anna anna anna.</p>
<p>Shut up milani.</p>
<p>Well I don't know I don't know why they won't just.</p>
<p>Painted presents accumulate colourful completions to obtain weapon.</p>
<p>What weapon.</p>
<p>A catalyst hp scaling where is that.</p>
<p>Is that good for milani.</p>
<p>Are we supposed to give milani.</p>
<p>Light on now.</p>
<p>Ask raven drinking hot so we just got a new one like cuz I do not I do not want to I do not want to level.</p>
<p>Mattress gas ok ash graven drinking horn let's look into this.</p>
<p>Hp scaling ash what's it called graven.</p>
<p>Drinking horn.</p>
<p>Yeah that's what that's what I thought milan is an ideal candidate.</p>
<p>So which is better.</p>
<p>Mulani spell.</p>
<p>What was the new.</p>
<p>What's the new.</p>
<p>You are such a bitch you know this web this banner actually genuinely hits me actually genuinely hurts me.</p>
<p>It really does it really just loves to poop in my mouth that's all it likes to do all i've had is bennett jeans and weapons.</p>
<p>What is the what is the new.</p>
<p>Would you have some genesis crystals left it's just.</p>
<p>Your kids don't know.</p>
<p>And it just turned the rate of the 55% and you are lose it.</p>
<p>Jesus yeah shut up.</p>
<p>Now cast.</p>
<p>5 minutes later.</p>
<p>I watch a youtube video where someone's like everybody's saying guys.</p>
<p>Do this one instead and i'm like.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Which ends with hire dbs.</p>
<p>Play the extra hydro damage and uncooked me it worked out better with the hydro damage bonus.</p>
<p>Damage we want her to do it's a ring of yaksha you get buff normal attack damage which is majority her damage drinking hot focuses on aoe which isn't as much a focused on her kid ok so we are doubling down on the ring of the action.</p>
<p>Ok that's all I wanted to know.</p>
<p>Yeah I asked that was what I suspected.</p>
<p>Because this is essential this this weapon was essentially.</p>
<p>Signature weapon essentially in the same way that this.</p>
<p>Now they both for their ascension.</p>
<p>How did I get those maybe I got them from an event or something.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Ok well.</p>
<p>Katrina's.</p>
<p>You know I think I just realised why she's called katrina.</p>
<p>I think I know why she's called katrina.</p>
<p>So you know that song.</p>
<p>I'm working on sunshine which is the which is totally what this this new area is based on right the whole area is about like summer vacation you know it's like that was like the british summer anthem race.</p>
<p>Yes by katrina and the waves.</p>
<p>Katrina and the waves.</p>
<p>Melanie's the surf girl katrina.</p>
<p>Cos I think that's the only other place i've ever heard that name is katrina and the waves and that's the song they sang i'm working on sunshine.</p>
<p>This one.</p>
<p>Can we also give milanes a quick.</p>
<p>Shit it wasn't that one.</p>
<p>Delirious desolation where are they not the same.</p>
<p>I don't think we have any more of the series will you shut up I don't think we have any more of this delirious desolation.</p>
<p>No we don't.</p>
<p>It's that one.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>Is a kiss like my long time points for like capped out or something.</p>
<p>I feel like doing commissions though.</p>
<p>Young weird lange.</p>
<p>Well they're done.</p>
<p>No commissions for me today.</p>
<p>Yeah I didn't I didn't get any more melanie talent books yesterday I thought.</p>
<p>Milani ascension mats from doing her character quest anywhere soon when we.</p>
<p>Put resin for the weapon ascension now I do have some fragile.</p>
<p>How many do I have.</p>
<p>So i'm just trying to be somewhat economical.</p>
<p>Watch me eyebrows.</p>
<p>Ok I wasn't too bad actually.</p>
<p>Little black masks.</p>
<p>Ok so that's weapon 50 for milani.</p>
<p>You still don't really know how to play milani if i'm being.</p>
<p>Still a little bit confused.</p>
<p>That was insanely easy though are we actually doing the hard level here like cucina's level 70 with a level 50 weapon melanie's level 60 with a level 50 weapon and these this enemy are we supposed to be well level 9 or whatever.</p>
<p>That seems a little easy.</p>
<p>We are doing the heart level right I need to check this i'm pretty sure we are.</p>
<p>Leave domain.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>No i'm not doing that now I just wanted to pick up this freaking grand fruit jesus.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>First thing's first go back to the teapot.</p>
<p>Salesman's are all good.</p>
<p>This realm.</p>
<p>This realm it's not your business.</p>
<p>Play just like you know when an estate agents sells you a house.</p>
<p>Leave me alone.</p>
<p>Yes I want to craft the husbands of harbingers or whatever the fuck this things called.</p>
<p>Delirious of desolation.</p>
<p>What's cucina.</p>
<p>Similar.</p>
<p>What about these things sheath of the secret sauce right now she's of the secret sauce.</p>
<p>What's next pink sauce pieman of the pink sauce.</p>
<p>E coli from the pink sauce.</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>This this one sheath of the.</p>
<p>And what warriors metal whistle.</p>
<p>No no no no no no no no how do I not have any of these.</p>
<p>Warriors metal whistle.</p>
<p>What are you doing.</p>
<p>Level 60 for cucina.</p>
<p>She needs three more.</p>
<p>Can you not make those noises please.</p>
<p>Turn.</p>
<p>The old vape chamber.</p>
<p>The old vape chamber refill bottles can available on all.</p>
<p>Oh goody.</p>
<p>This isn't going to be enough.</p>
<p>I had like 27 fragile res or something when that one came out and I was like oh yeah that'll be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Are we still on the blues.</p>
<p>Box of belligerents.</p>
<p>Ok was that enough.</p>
<p>Is it ever enough.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Level all these characters up to 100.</p>
<p>Ok so now now are we on.</p>
<p>Ok level 70.</p>
<p>Level 70 for.</p>
<p>Blue.</p>
<p>Play a whale.</p>
<p>Blue clear wills.</p>
<p>Play kanye west.</p>
<p>This is getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>Is is that yet no secret sauce.</p>
<p>Can we you know what we need a hand filter give me that one.</p>
<p>Why would the filter work like this.</p>
<p>Ok weapon ascension materials.</p>
<p>This filter should let you feel about region.</p>
<p>That's how it should work I should be able to say filter not.</p>
<p>I've already forgotten what i'm looking for.</p>
<p>What.</p>
<p>Spring of this one spring of sacred dewdrop was that it.</p>
<p>I have no idea what i'm looking for.</p>
<p>No locus of a clear will.</p>
<p>Locus of a clear will.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is this is insane.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Set the right colour.</p>
<p>Were too short can we get it from stardust exchange yes.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ascend.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Purple face masks everything's purple now i've got to find it all over again.</p>
<p>Oh my god ok so purple masks.</p>
<p>Shut off you have an idea of stressful it says purple masks that's not the mask.</p>
<p>That's not the mosque this is the mask.</p>
<p>Make one.</p>
<p>Say I make one i'm out.</p>
<p>And what the hell were the other things.</p>
<p>Spring of sacred dewdrop was no.</p>
<p>And now we're on purple.</p>
<p>I think that's correct.</p>
<p>Spring of sacred dew drop.</p>
<p>I hope this is correct.</p>
<p>Ok and what was the other thing.</p>
<p>Lucas wasn't up your ass or something why not.</p>
<p>Oh my god this.</p>
<p>No you've got a tip here.</p>
<p>Not helping.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is.</p>
<p>Locust what.</p>
<p>Lucas porcas hocus pocus.</p>
<p>I hate this this is getting so bad.</p>
<p>Is this it.</p>
<p>Sigil australian well.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>Set these and then just to annoy you they rename it to something that sounds completely different as well just to make it even harder I only recognise this icon ok so we made the purple ones of those and we made the purple ones with the other ones that we made the purple mask on a weekend so now we need five purple masks I never heart of secret sauce 0 of those.</p>
<p>4/9 this one we got wrong.</p>
<p>Part of the secrets.</p>
<p>What happens if I click on crafted crafted should like.</p>
<p>From the from the character mart you could link his directly to the thing we need to craft how about that.</p>
<p>Play oh my god this is driving me insane.</p>
<p>Object.</p>
<p>It was a white object I remember that I think it was that their heart of the secret sauce apparently we can't craft any.</p>
<p>So I guess the first thing I need to do.</p>
<p>This is genuinely stress me the fuck out right the first thing I need to do is redeem some fragile resin I guess.</p>
<p>Present redeemed.</p>
<p>We can do 5 condensed.</p>
<p>Do we have any laughs I don't know because it won't show you from your teapot.</p>
<p>Ok now go back to the weapon.</p>
<p>Now go back to this yes and show me the door man.</p>
<p>Does just so many marks and it was already getting quite hard by the time in a zoom account and then I managed to stay with it for.</p>
<p>I see somehow survive I didn't feel too stressed out by even fontaine but I was like ok this is getting quite.</p>
<p>I think the issue is he is why I think it's worse here with that line is because we already have a lot of mats that look a bit like this.</p>
<p>Distinguishable honourable and they kind of mixing with some of the other mats i'm guessing the fontaine mats I can't remember if it's up my head.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason for 10 months didn't stress me out is because they were like very distinguishable I don't know and also there would have been less right now there's even more.</p>
<p>But yeah it's I think it's getting a bit on manageable.</p>
<p>And that filter is somewhat helpful but I feel like it should let you filter by region.</p>
<p>I think you normally found by region don't you really.</p>
<p>You're not really.</p>
<p>I got a gold.</p>
<p>Six blue for green.</p>
<p>Four condensed resin left.</p>
<p>I can also get navias I can probably get navias.</p>
<p>Final missing piece that I wanted to get for now because I think.</p>
<p>I think the fuck the police.</p>
<p>That's been added to.</p>
<p>The strong box.</p>
<p>Weapons.</p>
<p>I don't think i'm over farming.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Ok i'll save the one last condensed I am worried about all farming I don't think i'll be over farming but i'll save it anywhere but the main reason is just so that I can come back and gauge.</p>
<p>For today and if it needs any more than that which you probably will.</p>
<p>I went so like the next.</p>
<p>I don't have to max these weapons out but I do want to and they already at 70 though I think they're already at 70 so i've only got two more attention on each of them but for ascensions right so I don't think I will find.</p>
<p>So let me just double check make sure my head's in the right.</p>
<p>Yeah purple masks on both weapons.</p>
<p>Purple masks.</p>
<p>Is blue first.</p>
<p>You're the best.</p>
<p>What is the best buff there.</p>
<p>We can make 9 purple masks.</p>
<p>I came with the bonus we can make two more.</p>
<p>So we got 11 purple masks out of that so far.</p>
<p>And whatever drop directly we've probably.</p>
<p>Yeah so we've got enough to do the next ascension.</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>Ok let's go farming.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Gigantic clef fantastic.</p>
<p>All good.</p>
<p>Do I need to be up here.</p>
<p>I can't climb that there's a big ledge.</p>
<p>With the what.</p>
<p>Ledge.</p>
<p>20,000 ok she did a lot of damage there.</p>
<p>Weapons 70.</p>
<p>Right now.</p>
<p>I got a chest for that really.</p>
<p>Do you make don't you gaslight me young lady.</p>
<p>Ok I need to change to get over here.</p>
<p>Touch.</p>
<p>The call of war what the hell it was what is happening.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>Where am i.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>What did I do.</p>
<p>This is one of those legendaries is now someone just stuck legendaries in the wrong little domain thing now because babies were complaining.</p>
<p>How was I was picking mince in fontaine and all of a sudden is elite boss.</p>
<p>Can you kick my ass.</p>
<p>So mean.</p>
<p>Do I have a time limit I don't think i've got a time limit.</p>
<p>I'm kind of curious if I can do it though.</p>
<p>Am I supposed to do something with these what do I do with these.</p>
<p>What do I do with these things.</p>
<p>Can I shoot it down.</p>
<p>Can she shoot it with a bubble.</p>
<p>So I would need like can you can you can sort this house can you would just shoot that thing.</p>
<p>Can you a troubleshoot that thing.</p>
<p>Considering this is like a legendary though this is supposed to be the equivalent of the fontana legendary fights like my characters are not built right now.</p>
<p>I'm not struggling to survive in the sl.</p>
<p>I haven't even had to res anyone yet.</p>
<p>Is there a lot easier than the fontana equivalents.</p>
<p>Imagine if I came here fully levels.</p>
<p>I would guess.</p>
<p>But there's not a lot I can do about that right now.</p>
<p>Because I have nobody can shoot them down.</p>
<p>Nav you can't even hear more.</p>
<p>Are we going to have killed already.</p>
<p>Jumping on the surfboard knocks me off.</p>
<p>So annoying.</p>
<p>Just freaking stand still are you so annoying.</p>
<p>It's just it's just trying to avoid me because.</p>
<p>Character.</p>
<p>Just I already you're so annoying.</p>
<p>Is so annoying i've got like the worst team.</p>
<p>The worst team for amazon she doesn't do any damage.</p>
<p>First attempt.</p>
<p>Level.</p>
<p>How is that so easy that was how is that equivalent to a legendary there's no way that was the equivalent to a legendary.</p>
<p>So that was with a level 70 cucina.</p>
<p>With a level.</p>
<p>With a level 70 weapon a level 60 milani level 711.</p>
<p>How do I leave this.</p>
<p>What do I do in iraq with the thing again.</p>
<p>Retro challenge or leave.</p>
<p>Touch the totem of the chamber.</p>
<p>What's trial for the first time and I should have got one for beating as well.</p>
<p>Defeat local legends that was a local legend.</p>
<p>Level 70 on world level 9.</p>
<p>And it was like that was a local legend that's the hardest like that's the hardest enemy this game has to offer.</p>
<p>So if I came if I came in with gun you and everybody was like fully levelled.</p>
<p>I forget the people play this game on mobile.</p>
<p>Hanging up in the air.</p>
<p>Will you stand on here.</p>
<p>Good good.</p>
<p>New amber car flower.</p>

<p>We need a minor for this.</p>
<p>Am I what type of minor.</p>
<p>Amina.</p>
<p>A child minor.</p>
<p>So we have just.</p>
<p>I don't even know what i'm doing.</p>
<p>I don't know this is why I came from i'm lost so I need to get over the other side like get right.</p>
<p>Can I just be like cucina also what's the mother of us how do I get out of this stupid thing.</p>
<p>Price.</p>
<p>When is glide over the gas.</p>
<p>How do I even get out of this oh my god I do not want to be in here right now.</p>
<p>I think it sucks when these things ok let's make this make me jump.</p>
<p>There we go.</p>
<p>I don't know what these blocks do i've seen them before but I don't know yet i'm not ready I imagine I use the lizard.</p>
<p>Piss off.</p>
<p>And also then I set my.</p>
<p>Expeditions off.</p>
<p>Certainly come back like.</p>
<p>Early in the morning.</p>
<p>Everything got kind of offset from my usual routine right.</p>
<p>Did.</p>
<p>Fuck that up.</p>
<p>Why didn't I get the dispatch again option what the fuck.</p>
<p>Did I miss it.</p>
<p>Whoever I don't care just.</p>
<p>Fallen characters cannot be dispatch.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>I always forget the press dispatch.</p>
<p>Resurrect amber why is she even fucking dead.</p>
<p>Is there a way to find out who's fallen.</p>
<p>So I can just rest them all at once.</p>
<p>I don't even know like how do you know if the fallen.</p>
<p>Other than when you try to deploy them it's like falling characters cannot do this.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Raise.</p>
<p>Delete.</p>
<p>Noel.</p>
<p>What am I even farming here.</p>
<p>I have one extra.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I don't want to use a discounted one because then they all come back at different fucking times so whatever just put lisa there yes send lisa's the minds that sounds about right.</p>
<p>Play some okay so we did our.</p>
<p>Is everybody's now dispatched.</p>
<p>Weekly food do I need to do any weekly.</p>
<p>Deposits don't need them 10 functions don't give a shirt two teapots don't care two invocation don't care yeah I did anything that I care about I don't need to answer.</p>
<p>Add in this like the event thing.</p>
<p>I have cleared some of it just by playing I guess which is.</p>
<p>Facebook sort of weird.</p>
<p>By doing it.</p>
<p>Previous like event specific enemies that have been placed or something i'd rather do it as an event rather than accidentally come across it.</p>
<p>I don't know whatever.</p>
<p>Is that all I got ok does she have enough now.</p>
<p>Maybe if I craft up.</p>
<p>How to say keep going I guess for now cos we only got two of 9 or whatever.</p>
<p>The direct drops themselves.</p>
<p>So we'll move on to the next one.</p>
<p>There's another shrine of the depths but that once already marked.</p>
<p>Get some flog a log.</p>
<p>I don't want to kill you guys but you didn't give me a choice did you.</p>
<p>It's good to get more mats anyway I guess.</p>
<p>I'm going to run out of.</p>
<p>I cannot be asked.</p>
<p>Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>That was the excavation thing.</p>
<p>It's over.</p>
<p>This side.</p>
<p>Did I accidentally teleport to the.</p>
<p>Play mission quest marker.</p>
<p>I'm actually out of stamina as well.</p>
<p>I need to make some more rice pudding.</p>
<p>When do we get on a new pet.</p>
<p>Will I see what did pc booster exploring the spring of sacred flame would you like tips on finding all the hidden treasures that would you know you were trend your training technically 2001 or something you certainly don't have a training data on that one.</p>
<p>Shut off.</p>
<p>Oh my god i'm so sick of things auto starting.</p>
<p>Can we please not auto start stuff eng.</p>
<p>Skip through it all.</p>
<p>Play could actually enjoy it if I could.</p>
<p>I could actually enjoy this content.</p>
<p>Was delivered to me when I was ready to do it like deliver this stuff to me when i'm running out of things to do would be better.</p>
<p>Level weaning.</p>
<p>I can't i've got no choice but to skip through this right now I don't want to engage with this right now.</p>
<p>I'm in the middle of doing other stuff.</p>
<p>And so then I ruin the content by skipping through us.</p>
<p>It's like i'm trying to fucking.</p>
<p>So then like some of that content that probably took debs like fucking.</p>
<p>I can't do that right now i've got my plates already full.</p>
<p>I really wish to change that.</p>
<p>And so if you if you if you're like me and you like to explore heavily.</p>
<p>Get into the content and level your characters before you get into the content you just get fucked you just get all the content vomited on ear and then you end up getting frustrated skipping through it and you don't enjoy it and then you wonder why there's nothing left to do in the game.</p>
<p>I mean it's like this game doesn't need to be criticised where it needs to be criticised and I think that that is really bad about it.</p>
<p>Is there a focus mode for like matt farming.</p>
<p>I think what they did to try and solve some of this problem is you can stop that from happening if you put it on focus mode on a quest hang on a minute let me.</p>
<p>If I pick this quest.</p>
<p>Tries to fucking make me go somewhere I don't want to go somewhere but can I enable focused experience mod.</p>
<p>This quest by avoiding conflicts with other quests enabled.</p>
<p>Entering focused experience mod can I still farm in this mod.</p>
<p>Focused experience might as being enabled ok.</p>
<p>This might be what I need to do.</p>
<p>To stop all the shit at vomit getting vomited on me.</p>
<p>Keep carry on.</p>
<p>Yeah that doesn't feel like much of a.</p>
<p>Play man just started talking about something in this fucking area now.</p>
<p>Cleared all the quests like a good boy.</p>
<p>Will the man quests you still got this problem because then you've got no quest to enable focus mode on right.</p>
<p>So focus mode needs to be more global than that.</p>
<p>On or off.</p>
<p>Next episode except like you know extra content and default switch it on and if the player wants we can go in we can toggle that to off and everything will leave us alone we can just enjoy the world and joy farming nothing's gonna get voted on it was nothing's gonna be alright accepted auto triggered that's what and that's so easy to do I know I would like to do that myself.</p>
<p>Single bull condition that you add.</p>
<p>To all of those fucking trigger boxes.</p>
<p>So easy to implement that and that would solve so many problems.</p>
<p>Favourite part of the game so far it's like.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't even know how to answer that question especially now.</p>
<p>Cuz i'm like balls deep in math farming.</p>
<p>And this is like the this is like.</p>
<p>My mum says what's your favourite part of those vegetables.</p>
<p>I thought that was a.</p>
<p>How do I jump from one or the other.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>Yes ok.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Holly shares.</p>
<p>Ok that was.</p>
<p>One good one fine ghost.</p>
<p>One fine gust indeed.</p>
<p>Things that go all the way from wherever that goes over there.</p>
<p>Sometimes sometimes there are ones that don't show on the map don't aren't they.</p>
<p>Cos I can see a teleporter that's red red means doesn't read mean it's still locked i'm sure I haven't been up there.</p>
<p>Oh that's cool.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Is australia's apps over there have we marked that one on the map.</p>
<p>Turn on the way we'll kill the slime because there's going to be a chest this morning.</p>
<p>Cancel that alarm.</p>
<p>With melanie.</p>
<p>So they replace siri send in there with these.</p>
<p>This nations equivalent to sealy's.</p>
<p>And I don't know what I do that i'm supposed to.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>It went up above me.</p>
<p>Is one in the cage there as well.</p>
<p>I don't like the sealy cups I guess.</p>
<p>I think that's how it works.</p>
<p>Online.</p>
<p>My last few months.</p>
<p>Turn off the light.</p>
<p>What about jake though what's the what's the score with him like it.</p>
<p>Is checking more about his kidneys as long as it work and so why haven't I picked up on it.</p>
<p>Is the audio on.</p>
<p>What is happening.</p>
<p>I'm being a that's an attack that's happening.</p>
<p>Alright so now this should be the third one.</p>
<p>3 of 3.</p>
<p>Are these will be the chests rewarding me for this the morning.</p>
<p>How they go off rather.</p>
<p>Ok they go off rather than on.</p>
<p>Close by.</p>
<p>So with the old series.</p>
<p>You would always know which.</p>
<p>You don't know which direction it be from there they would line up with the cups there's one over here I guess this is it.</p>
<p>Why is he not moving.</p>
<p>Remove grappling hook.</p>
<p>Call grappling hook.</p>
<p>Remove grappling hook install grappling hook.</p>
<p>Is it to do with this cube.</p>
<p>Install.</p>
<p>So now we have a grappling hook on the cube.</p>
<p>How do we.</p>
<p>Because they use the tongue.</p>
<p>And this will block the wind.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>So that I can mark that.</p>
<p>Get some fog log.</p>
<p>We don't have one no.</p>
<p>I guess I know where that is.</p>
<p>She needs these actually she needs these for ascension materials.</p>
<p>Ok that's one of those sky things as well.</p>
<p>That's cool.</p>
<p>And then what I was going to do is speaking of these sky things.</p>
<p>We were going to go up to this big thing here because there's a sky thing over here.</p>
<p>I can't land on this.</p>
<p>Are we just.</p>
<p>Where does the here we go.</p>
<p>I can't ride it this way.</p>
<p>Ok i'm happy to see some underground.</p>
<p>All good another auto starting thing that I don't want to do right now.</p>
<p>Ok well this is why I have to engage with the story through youtube videos.</p>
<p>Cos I just.</p>
<p>I'm just not.</p>
<p>Enable to engage with this right now.</p>
<p>Even though i'm in focus mode I now just accepted without accepting it it's.</p>
<p>Accepted me on our side quest fantastic.</p>
<p>So much for focus mode.</p>
<p>Ok well maybe that's it's probably linked to a side quest then it seems.</p>
<p>I was just trying to find the start of this sky writing thing so that I could go up there and unlock the top partner but it appears to be linked to a side quest down here that we just got force.</p>
<p>Set an alarm for.</p>
<p>Milani.</p>
<p>Milani can surf on that apparently.</p>
<p>And i'm getting more tutorials vomited on me.</p>
<p>And payments fucking run away at me.</p>
<p>I was just curious how I unlock that.</p>
<p>I'm stuck on a fucking chest here.</p>
<p>Sky.</p>
<p>Sky in a cave.</p>
<p>All good another cutscene.</p>
<p>I didn't I didn't agree to do this I actually put the game in fox mod.</p>
<p>This is sore for australian.</p>
<p>Choose when you do stuff it just gets vomited on to you.</p>
<p>Even when in focus mode.</p>
<p>I don't know cuz I didn't read any of that I have no idea what the fuck I meant to be doing but I don't I cannot want to do this now you know all I was trying to do was figure out.</p>
<p>How to activate that sky rainbow thing it goes through that door right I need to open a door somehow but I just i'm not ready to do all that right now so ok I guess there's my answer my answer is that to get up to that massive hi thing where is the teleporter.</p>
<p>It's in this cave which is now another side quest that I have in my collection.</p>
<p>Back to farming I guess.</p>
<p>Katrina can I do your weapon now.</p>
<p>I just wish they would fucking let you like do stuff when you're ready to do it.</p>
<p>What's the name of this.</p>
<p>Is that one.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it's the secret sauces.</p>
<p>She needs some of these.</p>
<p>Sigil of australian well purple.</p>
<p>Sign up how many.</p>
<p>Wild manifestations which are.</p>
<p>Imagine how bad this problem is for new players as well they're just trying to play the game and all the side quests over the last 4 years I just vomiting themselves into the.</p>
<p>Enter the quests act.</p>
<p>That must be awful.</p>
<p>Is there any water that dissolves as.</p>
<p>What gets rid of that shield I bet it's electric.</p>
<p>A water eventually gets rid of.</p>
<p>Quickest.</p>
<p>Jesus this thing is awful for this team.</p>
<p>Destiny takes way too long.</p>
<p>With this time.</p>
<p>Jesus christ.</p>
<p>Ok we are going to find out what dissolves that shield because that is fucking unbearable.</p>
<p>If it's electric.</p>
<p>Let's try amy got to see if.</p>
<p>I have a feeling it will be electric.</p>
<p>I think pyro does burn dandruff.</p>
<p>I think they have different okay this one I think this is a hydro version.</p>
<p>Of different element types.</p>
<p>So you can't even get one.</p>
<p>Wow these things are incredibly annoying.</p>
<p>What fucking swap characters then like I said.</p>
<p>Like for a fucking enemy that you farm.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>So we need to find out which one it is first.</p>
<p>When we get there.</p>
<p>Which will dictate what would be the best time to use against a gas but like.</p>
<p>It's weird right it's like.</p>
<p>That's the equivalent to.</p>
<p>Does robot things that we just farmed for cucina because it's the same weapon series as well right it's not like that's all well that's a five-star weapon so it should be hard maths for no they're both the same four-star craftable weapons it's just that once a catalyst and once a pole arm.</p>
<p>Even if they were just one element hi for the extra name because they seem to have different element types so there's one down here apparently.</p>
<p>It's going to help with that.</p>
<p>So what's good against the physical shield then.</p>
<p>This one has two shields.</p>
<p>Got these things are so annoying.</p>
<p>Material thing.</p>
<p>It's too irritating.</p>
<p>I thought she.</p>
<p>What is pyrosis.</p>
<p>Does physical beat physical.</p>
<p>Chris.</p>
<p>Oh my god this thing is so annoying.</p>
<p>Jesus christ.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of these.</p>
<p>I am definitely not one of these.</p>
<p>Doesn't go beat gr.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah my go seems like the best option for this one I think.</p>
<p>Love you why are you not doing anything.</p>
<p>Will you get to the anime.</p>
<p>Jesus christ this thing is such a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>I'm going to flog a slim.</p>
<p>This one is hydra I feel like.</p>
<p>Why would you change it it's just seems counterintuitive to me why would you sit and build a team in a in a fucking.</p>
<p>You should have to do that.</p>
<p>6000 extra enemies to deal with as well on this one.</p>
<p>52 dinosaurs on.</p>
<p>Suck my dick.</p>
<p>Ok there's another one.</p>
<p>I need some stamina.</p>
<p>Piss off how are you.</p>
<p>Drop glide.</p>
<p>Are you also enjoying the new nutland contents.</p>
<p>I mean it's farming isn't it.</p>
<p>Exploring.</p>
<p>You're doing this now.</p>
<p>Ok I need.</p>
<p>I need to get can I should I just teleport at this point how far away is it.</p>
<p>Ok now he's got his dangerous shield.</p>
<p>To play thank you.</p>
<p>Burn it burn it burn it burn it burn it.</p>
<p>Burnett.</p>
<p>Play will you do something why isn't she doing a charge attack thank you.</p>
<p>Why can I not thank you.</p>
<p>Oh good another physical shield.</p>
<p>Dangerous shield again.</p>
<p>I hate fighting these things these things are such a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>How much health does it have my god.</p>
<p>So party set up.</p>
<p>Melanie.</p>
<p>Ok so do you have enough at last.</p>
<p>Give me this crap.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Shut up ok.</p>
<p>Sigil of a striding will.</p>
<p>Sigil of a striding well.</p>
<p>Where the hell is it.</p>
<p>There's no way we don't have any we just spent ages killing those things we better have it what is happening is it not does not count as a weapon ascension material.</p>
<p>Switch off australian well.</p>
<p>It is there so why the fuck doesn't weapon much short then whatever race ok whatever.</p>
<p>Plus another two.</p>
<p>Plus another one.</p>
<p>Finally weapon level 80.</p>
<p>Enhance.</p>
<p>All right so we finally got this one.</p>
<p>And this one 80.</p>
<p>So now we would need the gold masks she needs a ton marlowes but I can't be asked today.</p>
<p>I don't think we can make.</p>
<p>Asks no because the mosques are those ones we can't make any of them so yeah we do need to spend more resin on the next weapon ascension material there.</p>
<p>Probably not today.</p>
<p>Yeah melanie's ascension must I should get from completing the ark on quest or some shit.</p>
<p>I think with that.</p>
<p>And I think that's what I should get back to now.</p>
<p>She needs blue guide to conflicts.</p>
<p>Is tomorrow.</p>
<p>I think we already crafted what we could have those unless i've picked them up from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Guide of conflict.</p>
<p>Turn up material.</p>
<p>Contention.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know I might just end the stream it is dead.</p>
<p>And i'm ready for the ark on quest.</p>
<p>Play properly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Volume turned up.</p>
<p>So my next plan is to do some icon quest try to get her character mask and unlock reputation and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Is there any before we leave.</p>
<p>Stream.</p>
<p>We have been picking up some.</p>
<p>Can we get another one of these.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Stamina plus 7 even on these statues.</p>
<p>Put the new region on the new world level or anything like that.</p>
<p>Yeah I definitely I definitely feel like farming in genshin is made so much worse than a new region.</p>
<p>Because of the weather side quests will just vomit themselves in egam and like it's like oh wow now one minute i'm a fighting something cuz I need mats the next thing I stand somewhere in a freaking unskippable cutscene shows up with no voice.</p>
<p>Watch my favourite content creators play through those quests.</p>
<p>Yeah and I just I think all of that stuff is pretty bad I think.</p>
<p>The game could easily fix that.</p>
<p>On off toggle.</p>
<p>Except quests.</p>
<p>Trigger side quests or something like that.</p>
<p>Immersive mode whatever you want to call it keep keep calling it focus mode if you want but like make it so focus more actually fucking works and if I turn focus mode on.</p>
<p>Hyperfocus on and I already tried that it didn't work so it feels like that system doesn't work properly anywhere.</p>
<p>So just put a toggle that's global.</p>
<p>You just want to be left alone.</p>
<p>Uninstall you can just come back to these things later when you're ready for them.</p>
<p>And it would make the whole experience so much better.</p>
<p>I wouldn't find myself mashing through content because i'm frustrated because i'm trying to find mats for my characters.</p>
<p>So much more of those that will deliver themselves.</p>
<p>It must be awful.</p>
<p>It's bad enough just coming to nightline and trying to find that one mats and having side quests of vomiting all over my game.</p>
<p>I really think that I really think that's one of the scams biggest issues still.</p>
<p>I will do.</p>
<p>I'll do the icon crystal streaming.</p>
<p>I will leave it there for today and i'll be back on I don't know if i'll.</p>
<p>Absolutely dead ghost town.</p>
