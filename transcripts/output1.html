<p>Alright are we good.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Making shoulders.</p>
<p>Let me see some.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>Youtube video about.</p>
<p>Play migration process.</p>
<p>Because.</p>
<p>I had like an existential crisis when I realised I needed to migrate a project from one pipeline to another.</p>
<p>Sometimes it fails to do the downgrade or whatever.</p>
<p>Play experimented and I i sort of tried lots of different things and I actually managed to find a good way of doing it.</p>
<p>So what I want to do is make a youtube video.</p>
<p>Wildlife.</p>
<p>What are the camera everything set up.</p>
<p>Managed to do that.</p>
<p>Make a drug addict when it comes to the stuff.</p>
<p>So I need to make sure that the version.</p>
<p>The version of demonstrating with is in hdrp yeah webgl is not supported with hdrp.</p>
<p>How the hell do I get syrup on the outside of the bottle.</p>
<p>This is why the tops get all.</p>
<p>So we can't use this version.</p>
<p>I have a few backups and stuff.</p>
<p>Let's remove that one from the list.</p>
<p>I guess I never had the actual folder open.</p>
<p>That was copied too I think.</p>
<p>That was the oldest copy the thing.</p>
<p>Let's try this one.</p>
<p>What's for the website.</p>
<p>Summarise the process.</p>
<p>12 hours or something.</p>
<p>But a lot of that 12 hours was like you know.</p>
<p>Getting over technical obstacles and things like that i'm hoping the next one's going to go a lot better.</p>
<p>Finch ball was an absolute s*** show i'm not going to lie.</p>
<p>It should have been called capy learns how to make a unity tutorials.</p>
<p>I kind of.</p>
<p>I'm kind of harsh on myself because I think you know god damn it like this is supposed.</p>
<p>Do you know the people it would confuse them more than anything.</p>
<p>Yes but like I really am diving in at the deep android.</p>
<p>And I don't know anybody else who really does this maybe this is the reason why nobody else does this i'm sure somebody would find this helpful the thing is right there are videos because I think most of the people do like what brockies does right which is to prepare to like figure out what you doing first so here's what brackeys does right I think and this is probably the better way to do it to be completely honest.</p>
<p>So brockies learn skoda.</p>
<p>Platform gaming in.</p>
<p>Start to put a video together you know and then eventually he has a one and a half hour video that's very.</p>
<p>Structured.</p>
<p>And go through all the steps that you need in order to do the thing that he's telling you how to do yeah I mean what am I talking about of course that's the best.</p>
<p>But I don't know maybe it could be fun but you don't see any of the pain and suffering that when you know.</p>
<p>What the hell is that exception during sanitization of visual effect studio graph.</p>
<p>Broken text in packages local.</p>
<p>Identifier yeah I think this was me trying to rip hdrp out of this project.</p>
<p>What is that even mean.</p>
<p>So you know what I might need to do I might need to actually get the original project files from github for this.</p>
<p>Yeah I think this was me trying to rip hdrp out of.</p>
<p>French ball.</p>
<p>24/7 like I am and never sleeps and somebody's like.</p>
<p>What the hell is happening to this how do I do this you know.</p>
<p>Please also is that really feasible.</p>
<p>I don't know the whole thing is an experiment my whole life is an experiment.</p>
<p>In experiment that went wrong.</p>
<p>This is dead this project is dead these were my failed attempts at trying to rip hdrp out of finch ball ok so we're going to delete these.</p>
<p>Play these anymore.</p>
<p>What's the website let's get rid of copy and copy three of finch ball.</p>
<p>Ok let's do that first I have a finch ball old let me just try this last one finch ball or I think it'll be that one you know.</p>
<p>Yeah the way my stream is at the moment right it's like.</p>
<p>Oh my god it's not even this one.</p>
<p>Although you know what I think I think if I just put it back to build settings.</p>
<p>That's not it's build.</p>
<p>Bill settings.</p>
<p>Good morning to you how are you.</p>
<p>Yeah I think if I switch the platform back to windows it should come back to life we're about to find out.</p>
<p>I wish something to bring me back to life.</p>
<p>How are you.</p>
<p>Okay it's doing things that's a good sign.</p>
<p>Sometimes also sometimes when unit is doing things it's not a good time oh we're back.</p>
<p>Can you make a video now.</p>
<p>Ok I can do it from this point.</p>
<p>Shin megane.</p>
<p>Sounds like.</p>
<p>Now look at me.</p>
<p>Get your addict.</p>
<p>That reminds me of.</p>
<p>Persona 5 was insane for me.</p>
<p>So he's what happened with persona 5 i'm kind of half a shame to admit this.</p>
<p>So when persona 5 first came out.</p>
<p>Beverley so whatever and I was hyped because I like persona 4 but I didn't know just how much I was going to love it so I think I think it dropped on a weekend or something and I started playing on the weekend.</p>
<p>Yeah I saw persona.</p>
<p>Bar block streaming.</p>
<p>Yeah I saw persona 3.</p>
<p>Remake or whatever on ps4 on sale last night actually I was a little bit tempted but I thought no if i'm going to play I want to play on pc.</p>
<p>What's my wish list.</p>
<p>I wish list this one as well because i'm not sure what i'm looking for no I think I saw.</p>
<p>Is acrylic revelation or something like that something like that revolution.</p>
<p>I had a brief look last night but I was also trying to do 6 things at once can you do me a favour I know you in the middle of stuff but when you get chance it will take all the 30 seconds I would think.</p>
<p>Can you do me further than can you just got a play compile dot calm.</p>
<p>Let me know if everything loads correctly and then go to play games finch bowl.</p>
<p>And then once again just let me know if you can.</p>
<p>I think it should do.</p>
<p>It should do.</p>
<p>I've got the sauna 5 royal all it's 20 quid right now.</p>
<p>Ps4.</p>
<p>So i've already bought this game twice.</p>
<p>I'm trying to.</p>
<p>I'm trying to live off the last of my student loan.</p>
<p>As long as possible before I have to go back to big daddy government.</p>
<p>Define mole liquid of ways to live.</p>
<p>But I just want to keep doing this i'm genuinely trying to you know.</p>
<p>I don't know find a way to be productive without being a f****** 95 slave words not going but that's not going particularly well that's the issue isn't it but you know.</p>
<p>We'll keep on it.</p>
<p>Ok so this game is we want to look for persona.</p>
<p>3 remake.</p>
<p>Rewards.</p>
<p>It's even cheaper than it is on playstation right now.</p>
<p>Yeah it's like 40 quid i'm playstation 4 right now it's going to play a lot better on pc 235 on here.</p>
<p>I never played the original song I would be quite hyped to play that it's just again.</p>
<p>The ironic thing is i'm trying to spend as little as possible while I don't actually have money coming in because obviously.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario I just have to wait until the next month right.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Let's make a youtube video.</p>
<p>Brilliant fantastic.</p>
<p>Alright that's cool thank you for that.</p>
<p>Let's make a youtube video.</p>
<p>Hello play compile here and as i've been doing my tutorials for finch ball I had a bit of an existential crisis when it came to the web build.</p>
<p>So that you can play the game on the website as you can see i've got it all working but I run into an issue because I built the original project using the high-definition render pipeline and as soon as you try to change over the web build it says.</p>
<p>Vip is not supported for web gl and as I tried to roll back to the standard pipeline everything just wouldn't it literally would not let me do it it wouldn't let me take it out so i'm like oh my god what am I going to do I cannot roll back I need to make a new project start from scratch it's going to be a nightmare got really depressed but then you know like her normally do I started like.</p>
<p>Off stream and I found a really really cool way to do this.</p>
<p>If you want to change graphics pipelines and it's not letting you roll back or anything like that this is what you want to do and maybe you just want like a mini game that you made outside in a completely different project you want to bring it into a big game so let's say I wanted to put this in my palm on the game is one of the arcade machines this is also a great way to do it okay so this from what i've seen is the best way to do it.</p>
<p>So if we want finch ball to be in standard render pipeline are in a different project let's start by making our new projects.</p>
<p>Better if you use the same version of unity if you can obviously if I was reason.</p>
<p>So we'll do built-in render pipeline and i'll just call this example.</p>
<p>Project.</p>
<p>We can have two versions of unity open at the same time so that's quite nice.</p>
<p>So while it goes ahead and sets that up.</p>
<p>What do you want to do is if you don't already have one just.</p>
<p>Tabs folder.</p>
<p>And then what you can do is you can actually make the entire scene a prefab and this is super super useful so all you want to do is drag and drop your seen icon which is at the very top of your hierarchy into your prefabs folder and unit will go ahead and turn that into a prefer for you the thing to note though is the prefab is only basically a list of metadata and a bunch of links pointing to other assets so you still need the other assets resources bring it into the new project but if you return the original structure and then you bring in the the prefab for the scene you essentially just replicate the entire scene and so we'll really need to do so he's our brand new one are you really need to do.</p>
<p>And then you'll see what happens if we actually go and grab.</p>
<p>Unique projects example so all you want to do is copy.</p>
<p>Make prefabs folder.</p>
<p>And just copy the finch ball prefab and she prefabs folder.</p>
<p>And then all you need to do is drag and drop the.</p>
<p>Didn't see your hierarchy here.</p>
<p>And you can see it's literally trying to recreate that scene but it's saying there's some stuff missing well of course there is because we didn't cop anything else over but this is a great place to start from so i'm going to do is i'm going to save the scene.</p>
<p>Replace files.</p>
<p>Call laura's assets.</p>
<p>The prefab that we've put in the scene knows where all those should be and because we put them in the same place it should just be a lot done now.</p>
<p>A little while.</p>
<p>This thing that's showing as an error is there's no input system it's saying what the hell is an input system and of course unity by default doesn't include the input system so that's an easy fix right going to package manager go into unity registry and just add the input system because we obviously did that.</p>
<p>Libraries as well.</p>
<p>So will install the input system and actually clear most of those errors.</p>
<p>You need to restart your editor.</p>
<p>Go ahead say yes to that.</p>
<p>Should restart.</p>
<p>Belly button.</p>
<p>Check the following logs for more details prefab instance problem missing prefab asset poke yes we I forgot to copy my puck prefab but they're going to tell me what's wrong right so I did.</p>
<p>I do have a pug prefab in here as well and I just didn't copy that.</p>
<p>And I guess it wants to reopen.</p>
<p>Still seeing asset puck.</p>
<p>Strange.</p>
<p>Hook missing prefab.</p>
<p>But I can ok I can point I thought if I drop the folder over it probably would have been fine prefab it seems to not like that.</p>
<p>That is weird.</p>
<p>What last time.</p>
<p>Instead i'm even going to include the metaphysical hole.</p>
<p>How much is it going to delete my prefabs folder from here we'll call it prefabs old just to be extra surf.</p>
<p>Child components that are on the prefab scene I just make sure we unpack it completely.</p>
<p>A placeholder for.</p>
<p>All materials.</p>
<p>Check these some of these art materials font materials wants work because what materials are internal uni so what we want to do is basically go and grab everything except the font material.</p>
<p>Turn on the material it doesn't like and what you're looking for is at the top there.</p>
<p>You only want the materials so we've got a material as 36 materials and a material that's a modelling partner I happen to know so what that basically means is there's one material that's embedded into the prefab it can't do that one because it's embedded in the prefab.</p>
<p>I have another that is that one there we go so once you unselect that you should see 36 materials and 36 materials only we do and then on the shader we just want to change it to standard shader everything goes white and you might think well.</p>
<p>No don't worry.</p>
<p>What basically has happened is the light sensitive is all wack so what you want to do is go to the sun.</p>
<p>Turn this intensity down.</p>
<p>Is it intensity.</p>
<p>Two there we go to.</p>
<p>Transparent so obviously if there's anything specific everything is now a standard texture right.</p>
<p>I haven't I know that my stars are meant to be in cut out mod so if I just changed that back to cut out stars come back so obviously you might need to fix a few materials here and there but you know the enticing is there the chords there if we run it it should run fine we've got no errors and we're now running in standard pipeline.</p>
<p>Live stream feel free to ask.</p>
<p>No that's a really neat trick actually.</p>
<p>I never really understood exactly how it worked but I kind of like was pissing around with that when I wanted to get you know my ai voice recognition thing.</p>
<p>So that was.</p>
<p>When I bought that asset.</p>
<p>Like an individual scene and I could not for the life of me.</p>
<p>How the hell am I going to do this.</p>
<p>And I realised I could make the entire seen the demo seen a prefab and then run that demo scene.</p>
<p>How is today's pc boo that's still how pc boo works because it can't be asked to unwire it all up.</p>
<p>Meaning of the demo of the voice recognition thing.</p>
<p>Ok so we probably done with that now.</p>
<p>Uni projects example we don't need that one anymore.</p>
<p>Fart.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Is that pretty much it I think that's pretty much it so fixed hey i'm feeling pretty good actually.</p>
<p>Turn all that working the game plays in the browser.</p>
<p>And i'm now feeling confident about.</p>
<p>That's such a relief to know that.</p>
<p>I have a really cool way of dealing with that now.</p>
<p>Answers first and there's a lot of people and I was I was actually.</p>
<p>Because it's it's typical unity stuff right where somebody will ask do you know what do you know what every answer was that I saw every answer that I saw on please help me change my hdrp project back to standard cos they were having issues every single response and I saw about 5 of them.</p>
<p>In the unity community was like oh sounds like you didn't back up your project properly maybe you should make backups of your projects before you make major changes to them and stuff like this like just people being absolute pricks like wow you are such a prick.</p>
<p>But yeah like.</p>
<p>Yeah it's just it's that.</p>
<p>Make the forums and stuff.</p>
<p>List of.</p>
<p>Don't like it it's like gear keeper in all like that I don't know why the community is like that a lot of the community are like that this is very gear keep reading they're very like you know let's shame people for asking questions if they don't fully understand something yeah.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Yeah and it doesn't need to be like that obviously.</p>
<p>Stupid ass with.</p>
<p>Get that one done fast.</p>
<p>Yeah and I fixed I fixed auto ads and everything on my ai systems.</p>
<p>Stuff as well better.</p>
<p>Yeah I think i'm going to reasonably good.</p>
<p>Yes right now.</p>
<p>What time is the things I need to finish my match 3 game thing.</p>
<p>Where the hell is my wuthering website on I can't see it.</p>
<p>Can I have any c+ libraries i've got this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>123456 78910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 I have 17 visual c plus plus libraries.</p>
<p>I never programming c plus plus that's just to actually used stuff that's just for like other people's s***.</p>
<p>That's the best part I don't even it's not like I have those because I actually use that language myself.</p>

<p>Alright but if my tragic wave catches us i'm not responsible for her actions.</p>
<p>Yeah but.</p>
<p>I have a feeling i'll probably forget all about it.</p>
<p>Since you put it that way now I do have some ideas for next year.</p>
<p>I want to try something different.</p>
<p>Invitation.</p>
<p>Raise let's see.</p>
<p>Said I was going to hang out with a completely different character.</p>
<p>Hazard revisited a new trial has begun oh my god.</p>
<p>The tower of adversity is reopened.</p>
<p>Good lard.</p>
<p>Where is it.</p>
<p>Will we lie to do we not get a free character.</p>
<p>Yeah I still I still don't have him.</p>
<p>What are we supposed to get him for free.</p>
<p>That's the festival one isn't it it's not like.</p>
<p>Unless it's the other quest I start the quest I just did.</p>
<p>Look at five lighthouses in huanglong collect information and help to historian uncover the truth.</p>
<p>I have no idea ok let's do this boring thing just cuz.</p>
<p>We almost clear that.</p>
<p>Oh my god I need 150 g for that.</p>
<p>Ok we need action and teamwork who's got a lot of action in teamwork.</p>
<p>Ok we can do the 150 grand that one better be worth it knowledge and action.</p>
<p>Knowledge and action you say she's good at knowledge in action.</p>
<p>6169 8568.</p>
<p>On 999 is me and I think him suddenly.</p>
<p>Is there awards for this.</p>
<p>300 grand.</p>
<p>Action and teamwork.</p>
<p>See gin she's great fraction but she don't know much teamwork.</p>
<p>969.</p>
<p>Only got an additional 150 grand for that.</p>
<p>But it cost me â£150.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Yum yum hair when I guess.</p>
<p>I still don't understand what the hell i'm doing i'm making this all up as i'm going along as well I have no clue what the hell i'm actually supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Level nine.</p>
<p>Do one of these action teamwork.</p>
<p>969.</p>
<p>You and you.</p>
<p>Knowledge and see what I was just an automatic mode for this is so freaking repetitive repetitive it's unbelievable.</p>
<p>S1.</p>
<p>Yeah thanks for joining me i'll catch a next time.</p>
<p>Moon shooter plum blossom pole and eyes click the random ones I assume at some point i'm going to have all these levels up but I am close to clear in it because it's not that much else to buy all the shop now.</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if that's how I get.</p>
<p>Moonlight offering.</p>
<p>Am I out of currency now yeah so now I have to speak to the book.</p>
<p>Get more credits.</p>
<p>I get knowledge and teamwork.</p>
<p>Knowledge and action.</p>
<p>Actually.</p>
<p>It never freaking ends do these things have a bloody limit a lot.</p>
<p>I said 4:05 so I couldn't get them all level 5 continue forever.</p>
<p>What are the whole things just meant to be time get it as f*** is not.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>And can I do that question.</p>
<p>Lost history it is saying tracking now.</p>
<p>It said we're.</p>
<p>It said.</p>
<p>I'm not getting telegraph to go anywhere.</p>
<p>But I genuinely don't know what i'm supposed to do.</p>
<p>Locate five lighthouses.</p>
<p>Side quest.</p>
<p>I know any of that means.</p>
<p>Do the daily quest.</p>
<p>Why didn't that.</p>
<p>Head to the top of mount permanent to gather 10-year-old silver ladders.</p>
<p>Ok well I use a 10-year-old.</p>
<p>Special compared to the normal lights.</p>
<p>Darcy's friend dad.</p>
<p>Is the special lotus.</p>
<p>It must be 10 years old specifically from this mountain peak.</p>
<p>I've got an email.</p>
<p>Compensation anytime adversity challenges certain enemy scar.</p>
<p>Pounds to attack at a high frequency.</p>
<p>Gaming experience I kind of wish i'd seen that.</p>
<p>Problem has now been fixed and we apologise for any inconvenience you have experienced please accept this.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>Cancel that I missed it.</p>
<p>So we need to go to the synthesiser.</p>
<p>Google.</p>
<p>And we might need some more money yeah I don't know that we did get any money out of the events to be honest.</p>
<p>I don't know that we did that.</p>
<p>How would you forget it from the new challenge thing.</p>
<p>Ok so we crafted another four.</p>
<p>And she now has.</p>
<p>She needs these things.</p>
<p>Some money.</p>
<p>So these are ff holder cars.</p>
<p>It's fine I guess.</p>
<p>But we still need money.</p>
<p>Yeah we still need money.</p>
<p>This one.</p>
<p>Do we get money for this.</p>
<p>Tara adversity I had this thing.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So if I take a trash team in first select take on my worst units.</p>
<p>Cost anywhere right in terms of like stamina.</p>
<p>Whatever we'll try and do the earlier flaws with the shooter team I guess.</p>
<p>Maybe you're a while.</p>
<p>Vertices.</p>
<p>No you stupid boogie this bugs out it bugs out.</p>
<p>Randomly.</p>
<p>Can we kill at least one of these things.</p>
<p>That would be great.</p>
<p>I'm glad you do.</p>
<p>Oh my god this team is so weak.</p>
<p>What does maurice why is that not doing my echo anymore.</p>
<p>Yeah I couldn't move you f****** t***.</p>
<p>Ok my shortcuts aren't even working anymore.</p>
<p>I've also not got that long left to be honest.</p>
<p>How long you can now cos you're not even built you like level 40.</p>
<p>Ok so I guess we can't take level 40 in.</p>
<p>How far will take a proper team in there I guess.</p>
<p>You can only use characters so many times.</p>
<p>So I don't know my.</p>
<p>Are the team would probably be her.</p>
<p>I still need a healer though i've only got the one healer at the moment.</p>
<p>What do I really need healer I don't know.</p>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>Do I need to be her I think I wonder if I can level her up anymore because she is kind of tragic at level 40.</p>
<p>I don't know how long before the coast guard gets here.</p>
<p>What's the other scores I guess.</p>
<p>F*** off.</p>
<p>Endless reverberation 662 health I wouldn't quite colour endless reverberation.</p>
<p>Ok I continue challenge I guess.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>I'm not sure well.</p>
<p>Play some sweaty try harder like wants to sit in.</p>
<p>Play perfectly with one character on each team.</p>
<p>Play never get here.</p>
<p>Why does that keep oh my god this is so irritating.</p>
<p>Why is my camera in that slot I don't understand did I put it there and nino.</p>
<p>Why is this so sweaty when no one's got any teams yet.</p>
<p>We need your best teams to clear the first two floors.</p>
<p>When they won't let you use your best teams for more than like two f****** flowers or whatever.</p>
<p>What are you supposed to do after that.</p>
<p>Completely.</p>
<p>Balance for wales then.</p>
<p>I hate these systems where it's like you can only use the character so many times does pure greed.</p>
<p>I'm already f****** bored of this it's just like oh my god it's just so grindy.</p>
<p>This is the first two floors.</p>
<p>Will try with this team but like oh my god.</p>
<p>Shuffle.</p>
<p>How good another one.</p>
<p>Could you give me a billion health.</p>
<p>God that was boring.</p>
<p>This is soudal.</p>
<p>You don't crack or something.</p>
<p>How much f****** health is this track while i've got a dbs shirt.</p>
<p>Grass fantastic.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Why the f*** is have I got a camera in that slot there.</p>
<p>Rosie.</p>
<p>Are you f****** kidding me out of 1 second left on the clock f*** this girl I am so f****** sick of this s*** what a s*** game.</p>
<p>What a joke not one second of that was fun.</p>
<p>1 second of it was funny just tedious b*******.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Is dots around like a crockett for no reason.</p>
<p>I already should just quit this game.</p>
<p>I just do not enjoy it.</p>
<p>Who won gem shot ask convenient.</p>
<p>God this f****** game.</p>
<p>1 second on the clock.</p>
<p>And then it literally lets me get the one like my time literally runs out by 1 second.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>What are the f****** trash.</p>
<p>I did it to get some money there we go I want some money.</p>
<p>Sick a farmer money in this f****** trash can.</p>
<p>Right I can actually I guess resonance skill will be the next one to do.</p>
<p>Ok and once again i'm out of money and i'm out of mats.</p>
<p>Big surprise.</p>
<p>Whatever i'll just spend the rest of my energy on these mutts I guess.</p>
<p>How do I take that.</p>
<p>Square and square does my echo but sometimes i'm asking.</p>
<p>How do you even change that.</p>
<p>How do I change this f******.</p>
<p>It's not that is a so how do I change the f****** wheel.</p>
<p>Is this one.</p>
<p>Spotify don't want anything.</p>
<p>What's the weather like on car and why do they make the trails make this look like it's a fun game.</p>
<p>Text software to seriously game.</p>
<p>Put the games nothing like genshin impact.</p>
<p>Play convert to the sweaty text.</p>
<p>Are play games to have fun.</p>
<p>No for allowed.</p>
<p>How's that down there.</p>
<p>Did I do dailies.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>And I spent all my s*** now didn't i.</p>
<p>Hello how are you.</p>
<p>Pressing all the wrong buttons for some strange reason.</p>
<p>I don't think it will be too long either to be honest.</p>
<p>I get a feeling that gonna have reruns pretty early on.</p>
<p>I prefer the catalyst game plan this game.</p>
<p>I'm using her to give her some companion exp.</p>
<p>Gamestop.</p>
<p>I can't do any more of the events.</p>
<p>Well there is a quest is that sparkly.</p>
<p>Is this a sparkly.</p>
<p>He's our friend apparently.</p>
<p>These are our friends.</p>
<p>I appreciate up.</p>
<p>Let's let's say it.</p>
<p>Ok look at 5 lighthouses in huanglong collect information and help the historian and it says please continue to advance the task.</p>
<p>According to the task step information.</p>
<p>Playing along.</p>
<p>Thanks more.</p>
<p>Is there any new area.</p>
<p>I know there's a lighthouse.</p>
<p>Where was it.</p>
<p>And it's like.</p>
<p>Shield over on its side.</p>
<p>Ok let me google this one.</p>
<p>What's the name of the quest lost history.</p>
<p>Let's get some help.</p>
<p>What's the weather in wales.</p>
<p>History.</p>
<p>Quest guide here we go.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Repair a lighthouse at any location have you got a map here we go.</p>
<p>So frosting harbour.</p>
<p>Which is east of the court of siobhan.</p>
<p>Frosting.</p>
<p>What is that.</p>
<p>There it is frosting harbour.</p>
<p>Okay so there should be a lighthouse.</p>
<p>Around here.</p>
<p>Actually if we if we look at the map.</p>
<p>Let's head towards the.</p>
<p>So I guess this is one of five.</p>
<p>How do we repair sat lighthouse.</p>
<p>What happens if I climate.</p>
<p>Is there anything about.</p>
<p>Now I get somewhere.</p>
<p>I messed it up.</p>
<p>I should start with that one I think because otherwise it's going to be awkward.</p>
<p>And then I can do that one.</p>
<p>They're playing ship registration extracting the latest log entry please.</p>
<p>Initiating voice recording.</p>
<p>Stingray acting captain moore recording this morning I received a communication from she she the bastard actually managed to make contact with some survivors.</p>
<p>Tell me that the disaster is over all the monsters have been wiped out and the crisis of human ear.</p>
<p>Resolved best of all the crew members stay behind on lander all safe and sound is nothing worth celebrating I was 17th month long voyage on the seas finally come to an end and preparing to return to the harbour where it all begins.</p>
<p>Does journey of suspense is finally over I don't want to bring it back the remains of supplies with me so I buried them somewhere near the lighthouse maybe they can come in handy.</p>
<p>Something buried nearby.</p>
<p>Something very nearby do I need my sensor.</p>
<p>I could use my sensor.</p>
<p>Solve the puzzle look a far at the break of dawn by the end of the light shadow.</p>
<p>Surprising discoveries where.</p>
<p>Look a fart at the break of dawn.</p>
<p>I don't know what any of that means ok let's see.</p>
<p>Show me where the final I can try using my sensor I guess.</p>
<p>That's not really show me anything.</p>
<p>It's not bag of beer is that.</p>
<p>There's nothing else here.</p>
<p>It's not working out as planned.</p>
<p>The guide doesn't tell me where to go.</p>
<p>But it gives me one of these rights I feel like i'm supposed to use this on something.</p>
<p>I can't burn those.</p>
<p>Play burn the.</p>
<p>Why isn't show me the final.</p>
<p>Thrown explosive charge at the thorns what.</p>
<p>Maybe I already did that.</p>
<p>And then it just says.</p>
<p>Has a burning the thunderstorm lighthouse and hacking at the terminal order to repair it so I already did that he would go look a fire at the break of dawn.</p>
<p>Ends with a riddle.</p>
<p>The lighthouse cliff and set your time to dawn.</p>
<p>Instead run back near the frosting harbour to interact with a golden beacon on the ground run back near the frosting harbour can we recognise where that is.</p>
<p>So does a teleporter.</p>
<p>There it is.</p>
<p>Head to ginza to find the historian.</p>
<p>Change all to find a story in.</p>
<p>Where he be there he be ok historian.</p>
<p>Have we got another chest.</p>
<p>And I guess we got a trophy as well yeah so that must have been the last one I think I done the other fallen from the from the sounds of a.</p>
<p>Continue to pull on the banner ok well I think that's about it for the day for wuthering waves.</p>
<p>And that was all she wrote.</p>
<p>Some obviously loving zealous.</p>
<p>We can have a look.</p>
<p>We can take a look.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Schedule the weekly customs let's do.</p>
<p>Bowl of noodles and an ancient invite event.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Notices.</p>
<p>What new notices do we have.</p>
<p>Another event.</p>
<p>Oh my god golden way the fiery arrival of new erit is summer festival.</p>
<p>Who is the hollow deep dive system to head to policy 41 to hunt for treasure.</p>
<p>That is events isn't.</p>
<p>I need to open the store real quick.</p>
<p>See you too.</p>
<p>Karen where did you for a while.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I can do a scratch card.</p>
<p>You know what i'll do the dog.</p>
<p>We're not winning today anywhere.</p>
<p>What's the feeling.</p>
<p>We don't need to because.</p>
<p>I'm definitely insane.</p>
<p>I thought so.</p>
<p>What is that what.</p>
<p>New or you know i'll.</p>
<p>Rainforest.</p>
<p>Gourmet.</p>
<p>Anomaly proficiency for characters with anomaly especially the following effects can be triggered for every 10 seconds energy consumed.</p>
<p>See papers I feel like that might be better than papers.</p>
<p>Is this actually brings her anomaly proficiency up.</p>
<p>So normally proficiencies really good.</p>
<p>Phenomenally characters in fact if you check the stats for each character.</p>
<p>The important one is what's in gold right so for piper to be fair attack and anomaly proficiency about good starts to get so her signature weapons actually fine but yeah that's not a bad one actually for anomaly units.</p>
<p>You can do whatever you like.</p>
<p>As wondered why you were.</p>
<p>Why you do such a thing.</p>
<p>Every single game that you like.</p>
<p>An air rating.</p>
<p>I'll take that.</p>
<p>All right so we've got complete the opposing whole series of commissions that I was a little bit tricky for me so I do need to level up my miku girl a little bit before I can take that on I think.</p>
<p>So she doesn't need these ascension mats actually.</p>
<p>Is that new commission available now.</p>
<p>Is it may well give those as rewards that's the thing.</p>
<p>I have a feeling i'm going to need to find them anywhere.</p>
<p>3 polls tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ok so this one is.</p>
<p>That's the banner that's the thing it's not.</p>
<p>Is the repair program thing finishes west got six to left but I think.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>So I guess we can't do that yes.</p>
<p>Do I need car or higher difficulty.</p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p>I love this tune.</p>
<p>Answer all the way.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>The amount.</p>
<p>Catalyzed.</p>
<p>Perfect dodge.</p>
<p>Can I reach that.</p>
<p>I need to get the blue square but I can't cos i'm already at 90.</p>
<p>Yes I can.</p>
<p>We don't even need it now.</p>
<p>It's better to go this weather.</p>
<p>So I wonder if youtube automotive that guy cos all I see is message retracted.</p>
<p>Audrey.</p>
<p>Activate movies on messages.</p>

<p>We don't have enough.</p>
<p>Let's move on.</p>
<p>Oh i'm getting shot at.</p>
<p>Please play 60% is good on a half so basically prepping for when we get paper now.</p>
<p>This is great.</p>
<p>Like I get the I mean this is why I stopped watching.</p>
<p>I think that's going to upset anyone who just wants to you know.</p>
<p>Enjoy watching somebody else enjoy the game.</p>
<p>Developments so i'm always like analysing these things from like you know creative perspective and there is a lot to criticise there and I can't stand the tribalism.</p>
<p>Expect people to get upset and not want to.</p>
<p>Support you if you're insulting their favourite game I can again I can sort of get it I saw it again.</p>
<p>After.</p>
<p>Triggering the.</p>
<p>Nothing as well.</p>
<p>The games some games that I play.</p>
<p>Yes i'll be slot 2.</p>
<p>Onslaught.</p>

<p>That would just be so stupid.</p>
<p>So weird.</p>
<p>Here's the thing for anyone for anyone who thinks that like one lake would be a massive difference to even a small streamer like me let me show you something.</p>
<p>I don't do this because I just don't care.</p>
<p>If I did.</p>
<p>Guess what.</p>

<p>So we got three of five commissions.</p>
<p>Complete a total of 9 battles yes if we if we run this again we should get that and that.</p>
<p>Ok should we do a level three.</p>
<p>What's the ballerinas that would be fun actually.</p>
<p>Ballerinas.</p>
<p>By the time we do it again.</p>
<p>How's going to the top one.</p>
<p>He just took health off I didn't need.</p>
<p>Yeah we cannot be straight away.</p>
<p>20% is good.</p>
<p>Yeah let's risk the combat.</p>
<p>Just once.</p>
<p>Will be ok.</p>
<p>We could use one of these.</p>
<p>Play it safe.</p>
<p>Is it good on.</p>
<p>That one's better.</p>
<p>I am hopeless i'm genuinely I am having such a good time then this.</p>
<p>I would rather have ellen than sokaku.</p>
<p>Remove one corruption we don't have one right now for about to get one.</p>
<p>Give me the corruption.</p>
<p>Yeah that's kind of annoying.</p>
<p>Two spaces before i'm about to get a corruption.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Any other point in doing anything.</p>
<p>Turn one resigning on spotify.</p>
<p>It'll be nice for alan now but.</p>
<p>They were quite annoying actually.</p>
<p>Close to.</p>
<p>Am I enough.</p>
<p>When she returns.</p>
<p>She'll have.</p>
<p>Recovered.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>Cars cause like what does nothing.</p>
<p>That was beautiful.</p>
<p>An amazingly good hectic combat system it's like mannequin fast and stuff.</p>
<p>Where is genshin's a lot more sort of.</p>
<p>Chillin take your time.</p>
<p>I love bath.</p>
<p>Nah i'm good.</p>
<p>Don't just pick anything.</p>
<p>I don't think I want to do this do I i'm curious what it is though.</p>

<p>I love this fight so much it's so funny.</p>
<p>It's so fun.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to do her wrong.</p>
<p>Play before and chance to raise the other.</p>
<p>That was so good this game is so good.</p>
<p>That was awesome what a good run.</p>
<p>What are good on.</p>
<p>Oh that's so good.</p>
<p>Take me to another one of these.</p>
<p>Three more of these.</p>
<p>How close are we getting the.</p>
<p>Make a bangle.</p>
<p>30 searches away.</p>
<p>I still can't believe she drinks hot water.</p>
<p>There's no way around it then is there.</p>
<p>Is borth shops are sold out anywhere.</p>
<p>So I still.</p>
<p>Tell me to farm as much as I hate to do it I need to farm the general marks to level up there's no way around it.</p>
<p>I was trying to avoid it.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do is.</p>
<p>Buy them from here.</p>
<p>Buy couple three more of these.</p>
<p>Did we disconnect from twitch or something it's inside dropped any frames.</p>
<p>That was random.</p>
<p>Very random ok well.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to make of that.</p>
<p>Yeah it's not enough to do anything really.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>We're going to have to farm it aren't we.</p>
<p>Basic material.</p>
<p>It is what it is.</p>
<p>I want to spend 100 I should do 80 for now.</p>
<p>It's a lot of energy going up.</p>
<p>Is the daylight 1hp.</p>
<p>Where does that get us.</p>
<p>I need to level 37.</p>
<p>Lights off.</p>
<p>Yeah it is rough.</p>
<p>So the problem is if I wait too long.</p>
<p>To buy it then like all you know all the mats that I would actually benefit from right now i'm going to need them anymore.</p>
<p>Right which is kind of dumb.</p>
<p>Bluetooth in my head and as soon as I have the thought that I need to go to the toilet it transmits a bluetooth signal to my robot parents.</p>
<p>Yeah ok so i'm going to get this.</p>
<p>Alright so i'll be right back.</p>
<p>Alright so I just did that.</p>
<p>And went to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Helps if I unmute my mic.</p>
<p>Have access.</p>
<p>Purchased.</p>
<p>Claremore.</p>
<p>3 extra batteries two extra boot bonds.</p>
<p>Extra and this is only at level 16 or whatever.</p>
<p>Yes so we got 100.4 1.</p>
<p>Special pole.</p>
<p>Interferes with them.</p>
<p>Be right back screen.</p>
<p>Play something from my my batteries.</p>
<p>Ashley should we save the coffee shop has these ranked up.</p>
<p>The thing that was stood outside of right now I want us to do anymore whatever.</p>
<p>Whatever whatever which coffee shop should we go to yesterday went to the one on in new order or whatever.</p>
<p>Play will go on 6th street.</p>
<p>Why is he never have what I want.</p>
<p>Why is he like this why does he hate me.</p>
<p>Why you hear me.</p>
<p>He never has what I want.</p>
<p>Does the other shop I think I already know the answer to this i've tested this before the other coffee shops sells the same coffee doesn't he.</p>
<p>It's not like you can get one rank up from one person one rank up from a different place.</p>
<p>That is what I think of that.</p>
<p>Where's fine it's fine it's not but it cannabis.</p>
<p>Can I have to be ok so we need booster certificate seal of which we have none.</p>
<p>Currently and she needs harmony 10 that's not too bad.</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>Level 50.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>Ok we got quite a few there.</p>
<p>Banana.</p>
<p>Coffee at.</p>
<p>I've got.</p>
<p>5 batteries.</p>
<p>Set fine.</p>
<p>I know it's unlikely but because we we don't have enough to do 40 right now without going to the coffee shop.</p>
<p>And I could get insanely looking I could get really good drops maybe.</p>
<p>You never know sometimes it will be.</p>
<p>It just might be.</p>
<p>Am I the last i've had a less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>We shouldn't feel bad.</p>
<p>I had a significantly less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>What do you mean you don't want 12 kids.</p>
<p>Shut up and get pregnant right now.</p>
<p>What year it probably not there's probably a little moving a little fast you know just a little bit.</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>But it was worth it was worth trying.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>What's the girls at battle passes.</p>
<p>You're free to play right but if you take them like a really nice restaurant you know.</p>
<p>It's kind of like.</p>
<p>I love me some sorry but I kind of sounds like.</p>
<p>It's true though it is true.</p>
<p>Traditionally.</p>
<p>I don't even know anymore.</p>
<p>I don't know I don't know what these kids.</p>
<p>I don't want to know.</p>
<p>Honestly.</p>
<p>And then take it back.</p>
<p>I didn't say thank you.</p>
<p>What the hell is that.</p>
<p>How are you supposed to make sense of that.</p>
<p>Play anywhere.</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>Put a reminder do you know speaking of girls it reminds me back when I used to try and like I used to try and understand girls he's trying to figure them out I used to try and like you know.</p>
<p>I give up.</p>
<p>What is two different.</p>
<p>The complain about the bad boyfriend who never washes the dishes.</p>
<p>Tries to sleep with all the best friends.</p>
<p>What is with his home room glasses and he's.</p>
<p>Yeah c sharp for dummies book.</p>
<p>Add on stanier.</p>
<p>People like that right.</p>
<p>I say.</p>
<p>Skip sucks.</p>
<p>Why aren't specifically do that but.</p>
<p>Nothingness so if we go to the coffee shop.</p>
<p>Either one is fine.</p>
<p>This is a surprise meeting.</p>
<p>It looks like it's saying hi to you.</p>
<p>How am I supposed to know if it wants petting or feeding.</p>
<p>Meow meow.</p>
<p>Ok is happy actually got it right.</p>
<p>Well you don't have the components that I need as per usual you know if I needed flame component should have freaking ice.</p>
<p>If I need a nice you probably have lost 5 ones like you do now I don't actually need ice but anyway just give me a coffee and shut up.</p>
<p>Robot talks too much.</p>
<p>Don't you dare stick that nose in my coffee.</p>
<p>You overpaid 10.</p>
<p>Tin can.</p>
<p>Where am I supposed to do something with these guys as well they're always hanging out on my street what the hell is your problem dude.</p>
<p>Don't say that seater that ali is really creepy don't you think why does a street lights keep flickering this street feels like a ghost and monsters they could be waiting for us around the corner that must be it I think I saw the lost soul how do you have the vending machine didn't you see it see it it was right there is this guy for real i'll just use a chicken hearted soil.</p>
<p>Need a vending machine you can't see the vending machine from there by vending machine i'm sure you means this one's me.</p>
<p>All I see is chicken something.</p>
<p>Kick the vending machine on 6th street well I did that for a hangout quest or something with nicole I think it was.</p>
<p>But I never did it.</p>
<p>Off my own volition.</p>
<p>Being dragged out for gatherings every day as emptied my wallet.</p>
<p>You know you have the power to say no sir.</p>
<p>Sorry your phone.</p>
<p>Wish screen right.</p>
<p>Are we got one of these as well i've got about this.</p>
<p>Another are.</p>
<p>Yeah very stressful for everyone.</p>
<p>Yeah like anything like.</p>
<p>Comparison.</p>
<p>Can help put things in the perspective.</p>
<p>Have I got you still talking i'm like halfway down the street shut up already ok.</p>
<p>The cat.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to be efficient with energy.</p>
<p>Yeah plus they don't have what I need anywhere.</p>
<p>Do I have enough cat foods on me how many cat foods have I got.</p>
<p>How many have I got.</p>
<p>Just in case I need them.</p>
<p>I don't want to meet the cat and then.</p>
<p>Find myself short.</p>
<p>What does she used just once the ones with the rockets on.</p>
<p>So I can buy two blue and one pink not the hammer isn't that is definitely the hammer cos she's done.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>If I could rip them out of you.</p>
<p>I'll give you some back at some point you know it's not like I wouldn't give you the forever i'd scoop you off the permanent like a few months from now and then you know stick some life back in here but all i'm saying is for right now you know.</p>
<p>So bad.</p>
<p>This is so bad.</p>
<p>What is this the thing that I can use the the other mats on the ones where I can like make-up for.</p>
<p>How far is either skills.</p>
<p>Ok well we got it a 55544 at least.</p>
<p>That's something.</p>
<p>That's something right.</p>
<p>Screw you replacing me with.</p>
<p>I'll show you.</p>
<p>I want to be silenced quite so easily.</p>
<p>Man of the match.</p>
<p>Mvps mvp.</p>
<p>What the hell is mvp anywhere.</p>
<p>Most valuable player.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't even know what that stands for.</p>
<p>Most violent player.</p>
<p>What does v mean what is v.</p>
<p>Almost valuable player.</p>
<p>Ok that makes sense.</p>
<p>Most valuable player.</p>
<p>Of all the terms that could be used.</p>
<p>Alright well.</p>
<p>So I mean can you really said that a character is mvp.</p>
<p>Character.</p>
<p>Call me cool.</p>
<p>Why are you so expensive.</p>
<p>I didn't even give me a free pullback for.</p>
<p>Ok well.</p>
<p>We're back to needing chips.</p>
<p>Ok that's good I got some money back.</p>
<p>We did 5/5 commissions would you get another 1000 investigation points.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>I'll get them off the battle pass but like obviously I got to work to get them off of our pass as well.</p>
<p>You don't get them from like any of these or anything.</p>
<p>No you do not.</p>
<p>Nothing thanks thanks for nothing I guess.</p>
<p>Are you on the weekly.</p>
<p>Last week.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because they might level my battle pass they probably do actually.</p>
<p>They're also giving me like internet level xp.</p>
<p>Family pack energy drink special.</p>
<p>Where what's what's with the special energy drinks.</p>
<p>Do they boost your red up as well fresh an icy commemorative can.</p>
<p>X 6.</p>
<p>7 batteries.</p>
<p>If I was to take a guess I would guess that maybe they increase your drop right as well i'll look at this is what I need the bastards.</p>
<p>Is that good 35 blues blues already got a father.</p>
<p>I'm not that desperate.</p>
<p>Also what's in this one.</p>
<p>And I get my 300 polychrome will I get my my 300 page currency turns into 300 polygram so it's not like I actually really lose that either like that's a no brainer when I get it.</p>
<p>What's my daily thing but I know you can't stuck.</p>
<p>Book like really i'm gonna buy that 2 weeks early just to get 8 purples.</p>
<p>Seahouse that's what I mean right that's sick is blue at this point it barely makes it difference.</p>
<p>I don't think you can get any from anywhere else.</p>
<p>When is the next battle pass.</p>
<p>Are we getting it it's literally next though oh that's 8 purple and 6 blue.</p>
<p>6200.</p>
<p>Exp.</p>
<p>Together 6,200 xp we did daily.</p>
<p>6000 turkish.</p>
<p>That's not what I need to get the next level what I need 800 to get the next level so any one of these would do complete one notorious hunt for example yeah this is my week.</p>
<p>5 routine cleanups is like 5 disc drive runs I don't even know that I need destroyers anymore.</p>
<p>I cannot over did disk drives for quite a while.</p>
<p>Spend a total of 1200 battery.</p>
<p>That's quite a lot.</p>
<p>Tomorrow on the last day of first class customer service but I can't get any sooner but yeah we could totally do one notorious horns and get those level mocks.</p>
<p>To skills.</p>
<p>Search challenge.</p>
<p>Notorious hunt this is what it's talking about I get 400 in and i'll level xp.</p>
<p>Are you bastard these ones do cost energy.</p>
<p>I thought they didn't ok this is probably it's probably cuz this is something different.</p>
<p>What was I thinking of that doesn't cost energy in this.</p>
<p>What am I thinking of.</p>
<p>Should I level my shark up.</p>
<p>Can I even do it.</p>
<p>I can actually jealous do it.</p>
<p>Are you fool.</p>
<p>I just spent a fortune.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>I need information.</p>
<p>F*** is wrong with you.</p>
<p>Yeah that he charges an absolute fortune for that last ascension by the way.</p>
<p>Whatever it is what it is done now.</p>
<p>Anywhere.</p>
<p>It's done now.</p>
<p>26 25 searches away.</p>
<p>Let me go because I need to figure out what the hell I was talking about or did they suddenly start charging for you i'm so confused I swear that when the game.</p>
<p>Gmail like recently I swear that weekly.</p>
<p>I swear that weekly's didn't cost energy.</p>
<p>Weekly rewards 3 of 3.</p>
<p>Yeah I think they don't these are different I think.</p>
<p>What's officially called in the game.</p>
<p>Notorious hunt.</p>
<p>It's not what it said on the battle pass star.</p>
<p>What's energy.</p>
<p>Yeah I think I was ok here's what happened I assumed that that was.</p>
<p>For these mats.</p>
<p>When I went to farm these mats.</p>
<p>So she needs these yellow arm things.</p>
<p>So we can do weekly it's 400 xp it's 150 it's all good s***.</p>
<p>So when when when there is no downside to this.</p>
<p>Which does cost energy.</p>
<p>Which I am going to need to get her as well.</p>
<p>I'm doing this to get battle pass rewards.</p>
<p>I would have ok the timer stop now.</p>
<p>I wouldn't have done this yet I would have done it later when I didn't need the mattress badly.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be too bad.</p>
<p>Oh my god it's not even done.</p>
<p>Cost weekly pass this holy s***.</p>
<p>Holy.</p>
<p>7 minutes 40 seconds oh my god.</p>
<p>The best part is we get this.</p>
<p>When he does there we go.</p>
<p>Now how far will I get her.</p>
<p>That's what I was saying they sell these in the shop dude.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it was like.</p>
<p>Yeah I was like 8 of those or something like that purple or six others purples and no blues so would it be less than what i'm getting now.</p>
<p>It's got like levelled one level.</p>
<p>My god.</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>Yeah now I genuinely don't think there's any other way.</p>
<p>So I already bought all of the character levelling arts from here and I also bought them from here.</p>
<p>At this point I don't know I feel like i'm probably better off just getting the boob on.</p>
<p>I might get shot on danny again possibly.</p>
<p>Yes I should get the benny.</p>
<p>Let's do to I don't know.</p>
<p>To ambushes.</p>
<p>You know what I can do now that I just realised something that I can do oh this is actually really good so for when I go into the hdd thing.</p>
<p>What I can do now is put andy I need to get her on disc drive store.</p>
<p>I can put andy.</p>
<p>Andy and piper.</p>
<p>It's about to become nekomata miku and ambi.</p>
<p>And piper.</p>
<p>So what I can do is I can be and miku.</p>
<p>Into the you know selection of randomised characters that it can pick.</p>
<p>That means I have to go through less characters that I don't want basically.</p>
<p>It makes sense to get what i'll do is i'll try to copy on these build.</p>
<p>For miguel.</p>
<p>I'll give her the better version of the build and give and be the second best version of the build.</p>
<p>And then if I get and be early in the run.</p>
<p>For longer.</p>
<p>Every time I do hollow zero because I have.</p>
<p>Choose from.</p>
<p>Disk drives.</p>
<p>15 purple and 17 blue that sounds like a lot but I bet it freaking that but it's like 1 1/2 levels but it's not even too full levels.</p>
<p>Okay get it to 47 so it actually got it three levels so ok.</p>
<p>One level.</p>
<p>What's at the beginning of 47 so it's not like a fool three levels clearly it's more like 2 1/2 but the half pushed us over to the next level.</p>
<p>So 100 energy at this point in the game 100 energy is giving you like 2 1/2 levels of exp.</p>
<p>View character.</p>
<p>Another four attack.</p>
<p>Yes a four-piece shark star disco which is an impact set.</p>
<p>Is it seems to work really well on her actually.</p>
<p>When I give miku and b's gear she's f****** good with her as you would expect.</p>
<p>So I just need another two piece of access and another 4 piece.</p>
<p>Shark star disco set.</p>
<p>Can we want to try and get yeah actually andy wasn't too bad to build I remember this because the only thing that really matters on her is in is impact anywhere but that's the thing right that's what worries me about.</p>
<p>That's what worries me about giving her.</p>
<p>Look at my websites.</p>
<p>That's what always me about giving her the steam oven.</p>
<p>Because it's an energy region is like the man start on the so this one is impact which I can actually buy out of the.</p>
<p>The thingy star.</p>
<p>It feels like this one would be better on her.</p>
<p>So let me just take it take a look what is this character actually called ching chingy.</p>
<p>It doesn't plus it gets a bit much.</p>
<p>Yeah see they're showing this one as well.</p>
<p>Also this one hello how are you also this one saying don't use a signature weapon.</p>
<p>About the weapon.</p>
<p>I see so stacking I see it's stuck in her impact bass off the energy accumulated as well ok the up makes sense actually that's all I needed to know.</p>
<p>Resume meant good.</p>
<p>Ok so that's fine we've got that on her I think that'll be fine cos I can also I can also increase the levels on that.</p>
<p>I've got a 6th street.</p>
<p>And we got to the gadget store.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you can buy this one.</p>
<p>Yeah I can.</p>
<p>Talk only stream.</p>
<p>You mean can you talk about all the games.</p>
<p>Do anything via.</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>She's at 47.</p>
<p>How to do it now.</p>
<p>Micro managing too many accounts and then I look at in the days over and i'm like great I didn't get time to do anything with that.</p>
<p>Is I mean snow bricks i'll get a jump in now and again and do a bit of court or whatever but like outside of that I feel like I just spent I mean I suppose not break doesn't take a lot of time to manage the last.</p>
<p>It turns out be careful what you ask for.</p>
<p>Play the stuff to do but it's not really fun.</p>
<p>So like I guess I should have clarified that I wanted fun stuff to do.</p>
<p>When the gacha games eat too much into.</p>
<p>Daily routine.</p>
<p>Whatever I want to do.</p>
<p>These are my two favourite games.</p>
<p>Who are the stuff.</p>
<p>Play johnny guitar.</p>
<p>1 hours wanted to play.</p>
<p>Japanese samurai game I forgot what it's called now it was on playstation and it finally came to pc so I got it.</p>
<p>We're all different some people are hand look better than others.</p>
<p>Ok so we'll just do 60s for now because.</p>
<p>That's how much you get in a battery so.</p>
<p>So see where that gets us.</p>
<p>So I can replace.</p>
<p>It will start off with having her in slot 1 actually.</p>
<p>Can she like crowd control or not.</p>
<p>Have you got the character yet I haven't I don't even see anywhere to get that character.</p>
<p>Yeah I felt I felt the last floor with one second left on the clock and he had like 1 hp left so like I just need to hit him one more time but this can't forget that made me mad.</p>
<p>What is a triggering this freaking camera thing and I probably could.</p>
<p>It's like one level jesus christ.</p>
<p>That is rough.</p>
<p>I don't know we'll see how things go.</p>
<p>Healer but like I don't know.</p>
<p>I don't think it's going to like.</p>
<p>Actually like tara fantasy more than I like that game.</p>
<p>When's the next time I get batteries off the bypass.</p>
<p>5 routine clean up switch would cost me a tonne of energy yeah they both require spending a s*** tonne of energy.</p>
<p>Either way I can't do it today.</p>
<p>Nothing the closest thing I can say to.</p>
<p>I like exploring games.</p>
<p>Having a new area to explore and all that s*** is fine I guess.</p>
<p>Complete the new exploration areas and that's.</p>
<p>813 hours.</p>
<p>I do like what they've done with this though with zen list of split the story question 3 parts.</p>
<p>So you just choose when you want to do each part and so it kind of gives.</p>
<p>What's the master bite sized chunks.</p>
<p>So it's good for that.</p>
<p>And it's pissed much better than genshin actually.</p>
<p>We almost there.</p>
<p>I am so close right now am I able to do this without spending any more energy.</p>
<p>It's made 100 million in its first month of release.</p>
<p>How could you possibly think it might fail.</p>
<p>Where's the other guy gone.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>What is gone.</p>
<p>What the hell.</p>
<p>Is it a burger is supposed to be gone.</p>
<p>Second buy 10 of those tiny ones.</p>
<p>He's not a fortune telly and I can't see the future.</p>
<p>I know what's going to happen though right this is i'm going to waste my money on these and then it won't be enough anyway i'll just be sure.</p>
<p>We did it you know what I couldn't do it with one look at it with one purple and 20 greens that's fine I don't care cos I just wanted to get it at.</p>
<p>Captain corbyn.</p>
<p>That's weird.</p>
<p>That's all I don't know where the hell you got that from.</p>
<p>Ok so we're looking pretty good.</p>
<p>All the talents are behind.</p>
<p>And her weapons 10 level behind.</p>
<p>I got a weird notification saying I was.</p>
<p>I went live when the stream which is weird.</p>
<p>Can I not get these drops.</p>
<p>How many how many 93%.</p>
<p>Starl.</p>
<p>I need these kind of save me.</p>
<p>2016 ok.</p>
<p>And also I need more money.</p>
<p>24 hours i've managed to get a level 50.</p>
<p>I think was already level 50 because I give it to him originally so that was lucky she's got andy's disc drives for now.</p>
<p>I've got her i've got her skills up to 55.</p>
<p>544.</p>
<p>You got my channel that says i'm live.</p>
<p>When you just come out.</p>
<p>Everything's fine.</p>
<p>Everything is fine.</p>
<p>Sounds like a you problem.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know what I could have saved me some denny's.</p>
<p>What's that would have been all I needed but that's fine cuz what I can do is I can give that to I don't know.</p>
<p>Should we make nekomata 60 they'll probably be reward for doing that one.</p>
<p>Play my first level 60 character.</p>
<p>We don't have enough time.</p>
<p>I just showed you my youtube channel I don't look I don't know what.</p>
<p>This is right here that i'm live.</p>
<p>It shows the stream radio.</p>
<p>So I can't.</p>
<p>I can't help you.</p>
<p>I don't run youtube.</p>
<p>But if it's working you know what I mean all I can do is check to see if it's working the wet supposed to from my android and it is so.</p>
<p>Does w engine.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Two batteries.</p>
<p>And I don't think i'll be enough.</p>
<p>You know what I might do.</p>
<p>No I don't know if I should do that.</p>
<p>I don't know because I have I have this boo guy right levels quite high up.</p>
<p>I want you I should actually try and get a different one how do you change which one you look for.</p>
<p>Play that's the electric one.</p>
<p>What did you do.</p>
<p>He could be quite good to use with her.</p>
<p>But my team is still 2/3 physical that's why i'm just going like hannah nuts on.</p>
<p>Box galaxy and recycle these old engines.</p>
<p>What do I get for it.</p>
<p>It won't tell you i'm live.</p>
<p>Are there resisting physical nowhere.</p>
<p>Resisting physical.</p>
<p>Is literally only miku could do anything.</p>
<p>That's funny.</p>
<p>3693 so it's going to be 6.</p>
<p>Set a 6 we've got now.</p>
<p>Plus the two I think we had so that's going to be 8.</p>
<p>15 northern shea.</p>
<p>I'm looking at the wrong thing again.</p>
<p>Mia 8 of 16 which is exactly half of what we need.</p>
<p>Last barry.</p>
<p>Yeah also.</p>
<p>And it will be immune of fire.</p>
<p>You don't so all you want to do is play with your new toy write like.</p>
<p>But the enemies you need to fight to build clay a resistance of clay so it's like you're not allowed to use your new toy for this it's the same with this is except to be fair there resisting physical not electric but it's.</p>
<p>How to spell my physical team.</p>
<p>I could try her with the other two.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>I guess this means we get to try out.</p>
<p>Properly.</p>
<p>So we got another 6.</p>
<p>One shards I had this.</p>
<p>It's so annoying.</p>
<p>One one green would make one blue but that would be one of three blue.</p>
<p>I'll literally be like one of the smallest versions of the component short to do the freaking thing that I need to do.</p>
<p>At least this let's you go and just spend 20 energy though.</p>
<p>Refresher.</p>
<p>Polychrome.</p>
<p>Simulation.</p>
<p>I need to do a refresh with pollici.</p>
<p>And I just need one I think.</p>
<p>Sound like that they do that in this game is why you can't do that and then other games I think that's really cool.</p>
<p>No I can't cuz we need.</p>
<p>When is money how much money do we need we need 100 grand pretty much 90 grand.</p>
<p>I'm ready 82 grand.</p>
<p>82 grand.</p>
<p>I think I left some.</p>
<p>Unclaimed sofia.</p>
<p>50 60 70 80.</p>
<p>85 so let's just get 20 out well i'm going to want to level it anywhere I need to be fair.</p>
<p>I'll just get it all.</p>
<p>175 grand.</p>
<p>Why do I keep going with the wrong freaking thing right we can do it are you ready.</p>
<p>That's not bad though 54 to be fair not everybody else's weapon is levelled up to 60 if we look at one neck or matters is stuck a cos i'm going to get her about a weapon so that came out as just staying at 50 for now I was probably going to stay at 54 hour cos i'm going to get her about a weapon but if we look right.</p>
<p>53.</p>
<p>Do not use karen i'll get pipe is.</p>
<p>55.</p>
<p>Is it sunny is it only showing me stun characters.</p>
<p>51.</p>
<p>That's not bad.</p>
<p>And I guess with the 40 energy that's left we should probably just make a star on her final ascension mats I reckon.</p>
<p>Like in final fantasy 14 you can turn down how much visual effects and stuff.</p>
<p>Hurricane on the screen.</p>
<p>That is a much better.</p>
<p>This is a much better test for this particular team.</p>
<p>Crazy on the.</p>
<p>People are saying you can dodge without interrupting her combo.</p>
<p>But they're using mouse so I don't know how much do that on the controller because that's super awkward to do.</p>
<p>And you know what that's this is what we got stuck on I mean I don't know it's worth a shot.</p>
<p>Alright the thing I tried to do yesterday.</p>
<p>Let's let's retry the thing I couldn't clear yesterday.</p>
<p>Play the new team.</p>
<p>I doubt i'll be able to do it now because she's still not fully levelled and you know.</p>
<p>It was really hard.</p>
<p>What's the hour make you aware.</p>
<p>Let's see how it goes.</p>
<p>Play rotations down or anything.</p>
<p>Pick it up.</p>
<p>That's the thing.</p>
<p>So that might not necessarily be an issue with her specifically.</p>
<p>I hate these things this is not going to go well.</p>
<p>She's almost dead.</p>
<p>How is she still alive.</p>
<p>Levels.</p>
<p>S***.</p>
<p>Has lost paper.</p>
<p>I haven't done.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Am I actually do this.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>How am I still alive.</p>
<p>No she said.</p>
<p>Windows stars.</p>
<p>Ok so miku might be a much bigger upgrade than I initially thought or maybe it's played a lot better than I did yesterday.</p>
<p>But also she's still stuck at level 50 which is crazy right and she still got lost skill levels so she's got a lot like a bit more.</p>
<p>Quiet to begin.</p>
<p>Which is more than I could do yesterday so yeah I don't know.</p>
<p>How about the same as yesterday probably.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't know why you saying that engines gonna look graphically better.</p>
<p>Upgrade which is not.</p>
<p>Are they just mean.</p>
<p>More appealing with new regions.</p>
<p>But yeah hey talk about like.</p>
<p>And yesterday piper died first so she she out lasted paper and she said she still not fully built about the time like she's level 60 or whatever.</p>
<p>And that weapons level 16 we've got a few more talents in like putting.</p>
<p>So i'm actually i'm actually kind of.</p>
<p>I'm very impressed actually.</p>
<p>Add an expected to be that much of an upgrade.</p>
<p>To really make the master of a cat.</p>
<p>Which can get a bit tiring.</p>
<p>I didn't I didn't hear anything about that.</p>
<p>I didn't even know they were doing that.</p>
<p>How do I get needs one.</p>
<p>Was it even mean.</p>
<p>What is the technical technical.</p>
<p>Fancy.</p>
<p>You haven't already given details about it.</p>
<p>But I also think you know as long as the games fun to play it's certainly not the most important thing the concentrate on.</p>
<p>And sometimes like I don't know.</p>
<p>What's the time it's fine but now and again genshin will stutter a little bit as it is so.</p>
<p>Miku is now.</p>
<p>Level 50.</p>
<p>We made a start on a final ascension but she's.</p>
<p>Weapon was it like what 55 think.</p>
<p>Weapon from the shop.</p>
<p>So and be once she reads reaches max level she's not going to get any stronger unless you either one get constellations.</p>
<p>Fidelity than it was you know last week like overall you probably you know you're probably just feel like ok yeah this game looks great but it always looks great anyway so.</p>
<p>Any issues with graphics.</p>
<p>Give me the difference but.</p>
<p>Play I don't I have the observation skills of a rock anywhere I wouldn't be able to tell you what was different.</p>
<p>Yeah I think that was booked when he was when he was gone before I think that was a bug.</p>
<p>What is back now.</p>
<p>How much away with disappeared.</p>
<p>New world oh yeah they are.</p>
<p>Annoying.</p>
<p>Yeah I don't care about any of that.</p>
<p>All the camera is are the new cactus fun they look fun.</p>
<p>When is the new regent going to be good.</p>
<p>So you know.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about as if they you know if the new regions crap and it doesn't look crap or if the new characters were crap when they also don't look crap so i'm sure I have no doubt i'll be fantastic it always is.</p>
<p>World levels are just numbers.</p>
<p>I don't know nobody's really talking about that.</p>
<p>Talk not.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>They already have level 100 enemies.</p>
<p>I think it's just going to make the enemy stronger make the game a bit more challenging and you get slightly bigger drops for doing it.</p>
<p>I don't think we're gonna.</p>
<p>Yoga quite a few of.</p>
<p>So andy has a 4 piece.</p>
<p>Shark star disco.</p>
<p>4 years old louis 2 months old.</p>
<p>They don't have to worry about world level today.</p>
<p>Genesis doing it to try and make the game feel like it's not as it actually is.</p>
<p>So I can check that by clicking on these.</p>
<p>Do anyone that has impact on it is slots 6 I think.</p>
<p>Right so the only thing that matters for one of these impact characters is a slot 6 on impact.</p>
<p>I actually don't think that matters will keep the impact ones and those ones don't matter either.</p>
<p>So we could actually scrap the rest of those.</p>
<p>What are you waffle on all about woman shut up.</p>
<p>Well if you got to play compile dot calm.</p>
<p>And click on the play compile menu option.</p>
<p>If you click on play compile on the play compile website.</p>
<p>You can see discord at the bottom.</p>
<p>Then you can just say you can join the discard that way.</p>
<p>Right i'm not answering any questions about war world level because the stupid questions.</p>
<p>Ok let's take a look to see.</p>
<p>Ok let's take a look to see what we've got.</p>
<p>So and be basically needs.</p>
<p>A four-piece shark star discuss that.</p>
<p>Add two piece of tax app.</p>
<p>We didn't get any for slot worn apparently.</p>
<p>Give a attack crit rate hp defence.</p>
<p>Pretty much the same thing.</p>
<p>So we can give a crit damage.</p>
<p>It's because you asked.</p>
<p>Do you think wuthering was already answered your question that's why you said do I think withering waves will follow again s*** like copy genshin impact and raise its world level like soon.</p>
<p>Play 4 years from now.</p>
<p>And less than not copying genshin in the copying tarot fantasy and they're just going to keep rising it every now and again anyway and they were already planning on doing that but that wasn't your question your question is if you think they would do that to copy genshin impact.</p>
<p>Race hp quick damage.</p>
<p>It's not a very good piece to be honest these are all trash somebody get rid of that and i'm going to get rid of that.</p>
<p>I'm good how are you.</p>
<p>So we got hp on this one but I think it could be attack right this could either be an elemental damage bonus so like here we got electric damage bonus.</p>
<p>Are we can get attack either of those is fine but we don't want any pizza we want to get rid of that one as well.</p>
<p>Slots 6 we didn't get.</p>
<p>Yeah pretty good.</p>
<p>Energy region i'm not sure why that's locked.</p>
<p>Can we get rid of that as well to be completely honest.</p>
<p>Yes I am.</p>
<p>I do my own graphics so i'm not interested thank you if.</p>
<p>Yeah I think i'm talking about.</p>
<p>Morgan.</p>
<p>Yeah i'm going to use these purple ones first because we should get some gold out of it.</p>
<p>Where is the bonus we don't want that.</p>
<p>Everything everything about it is a good game.</p>
<p>Ok so now we're down to singles.</p>
<p>So we'll see what we got.</p>
<p>Play randomly.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>Call dad.</p>
<p>Ok so now we're down we'll actually one more purple yeah we can.</p>
<p>Ok come on give me a good one oh my god that's terrible.</p>
<p>It's so bad.</p>
<p>Ok so now we've got a try tuning the goals so basically.</p>
<p>Believe it to chance and just let it do a random one.</p>
<p>Apparently i've got a.</p>
<p>So let's see what we got.</p>
<p>Does hours go by really quick.</p>
<p>Jesus that's bad.</p>
<p>I need to make sure I remember which one is defensive one of them is defence anywhere.</p>
<p>Ok let me just check actually.</p>
<p>So one is always hp.</p>
<p>Who is always attack and three is always.</p>
<p>I swear that's the same as the one i've already just got oh my god why am I getting shut on so badly for this.</p>
<p>It is are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Penetration crit damage and attack percent.</p>
<p>Ok penetrations pretty good.</p>
<p>Why I always feel like i'm talking about an interview whenever you shut up.</p>
<p>How do you feel.</p>
<p>Like I don't know it probably going to be the first thing I play so i'll probably be on the morning.</p>
<p>Depends what my energy systems are doing right.</p>
<p>Energy system is going to be like recharging at around the evening time.</p>
<p>So then that makes perfect sense for me to do the engine stream earlier amazon later because.</p>
<p>What do you think about it.</p>
<p>I can't believe it just screwed me like that.</p>
<p>Should I ask specifically for a slot 6 or should I just use my thing on it that's the thing.</p>
<p>I don't want to ask specifically for a slot 6 because if i'm going to get down of that.</p>
<p>Right so this one's defense anywhere.</p>
<p>But spaghetti fence again.</p>
<p>And anomaly proficiency doesn't mean anything for a stun character.</p>
<p>Salon feel good about that one either.</p>
<p>Penetration is good for an impact character crit rate is good because we've got quick damage on the other one and attack present is always good.</p>
<p>80%.</p>
<p>That's fine.</p>
<p>Gear pieces we need to see if any of them raw better.</p>
<p>What miku's already got now the thing is we don't have much control over which one's going which slots the right because it's all r&g.</p>
<p>So are the clip that one.</p>
<p>Lock it.</p>
<p>Now if we check miku.</p>
<p>To be honest cos there's no rush to do this this is just so that we've got ambience stand by so we can use a for something like the hollows right.</p>
<p>Am I coming with again you know like they have nothing to do with each other like I don't I don't can.</p>
<p>I mean sometimes right so there are two types of games that I play there are games already give a s*** about that I play because I like and then sometimes there are games i'll just play cuz there's nothing better to play.</p>
<p>Where was the game that I played because there's nothing better to play.</p>
<p>So it might look so yeah when gingin comes out i'm not going to give a s*** about work because i've got a better game before.</p>
<p>But i'm not canning will a fog engine that's not how it.</p>
<p>It's just that oh well now we don't have anything.</p>
<p>We don't have to fill the void with something you know that we don't really give two s**** of our because there's better stuff to do right.</p>
<p>Fox yes.</p>
<p>Exactly the same.</p>
<p>And try and get a sloth.</p>
<p>Write an a sloth sex.</p>
<p>In shock starter score.</p>
<p>Why is if we end up with a better piece.</p>
<p>On andy will give that to me who cosmic is like priority.</p>
<p>If I mix up the slots then I can't.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>Attack percentage hp defence.</p>
<p>You know what for now it's fine at.</p>
<p>The hp defence.</p>
<p>These are only like standby characters anywhere right we're using unbi as a standby character.</p>
<p>Now this is where things get a little bit tricky.</p>
<p>And the reason it gets tricky now is we need to fill slots 6 slot 5 and slot 46 has to 100% be impact.</p>
<p>Nothing else is good enough.</p>
<p>Slot 5 has to be 100% either electric damage bonus are attack percent.</p>
<p>Slot 4.</p>
<p>Slot 4 is fine as it as long as it's percent attack crit rate or crit damage honestly I think it's.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Now we do have a.</p>
<p>The best ok well we need to do is min-max the s*** out of this so the best way to do this right is to use simple maths right.</p>
<p>So here we have.</p>
<p>123456 right we have 6 starts that it can be.</p>
<p>And there are three of them.</p>
<p>That we don't want so basically it's a one and it's a 50/50 chance of getting a good start on this.</p>
<p>We've got a pretty high chance of hitting something that we want.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Don't even say anything don't even say anything.</p>
<p>To be fair what I said is absolute bulshit by the way you know how I said there's a one and two chance of getting a start that we want that that's not actually true and the reason why is because higher the bastards right.</p>
<p>They give the better start that's got pen on it that's actually pretty good they give the better start a lower chance of rolling so it's not really a 50/50 but you know in terms of what starts we could have got any kind of was.</p>
<p>Pens good for an impact character.</p>
<p>I'll do for now.</p>
<p>I and give her the.</p>
<p>Who's the richest got for a so we got a one.</p>
<p>Hp not too bad.</p>
<p>It is what it is right.</p>
<p>Now we need a slot 5 attack piece.</p>
<p>Use my resin thing right.</p>
<p>So let's do this slot 5.</p>
<p>Now we're getting now it's getting tricky ok now it's getting really tricky.</p>
<p>Block 5 we will accept.</p>
<p>5% we will accept.</p>
<p>Electric damage bonus.</p>
<p>Everything else.</p>
<p>Goes in the bin.</p>
<p>So how many is that that's one two three four five six seven eight nine things that can be.</p>
<p>I'm already interested in two of them.</p>
<p>So we have we only have a 2 in 9 chance of getting something we want.</p>
<p>I believe.</p>
<p>Do you see this.</p>
<p>Penrith what is pen ratio we just got penetration ratio and pen as a substance that's double pen I didn't even think pen was a thing on here.</p>
<p>Oh my god this is a god.</p>
<p>Turn impact unit i'm not even joking that is actually amazing I think mikey's going to end up getting this one because that was not we just got double pen on the same piece first attempt let's go now all we need is one piece.</p>
<p>Which means.</p>
<p>I need to we need to save enough.</p>
<p>We need six of these six.</p>
<p>Attempts and if it fails on the third r&g attempt we're going to use the resin that's what we're going to do.</p>
<p>All right let's go we need impacts.</p>
<p>Where's that impact piece because that was so good I think I locked it already anyway that one can go in the bin.</p>
<p>What are you worth learning about when this woman is driving me insane.</p>
<p>It's good that it didn't role in pack you know why I forgot to change the set we need a shock star disco set for this that would have been devastating if it actually was impact will not really because we could just swap some things around but that would have ruined our whole thing right.</p>
<p>That would have ruined our whole thing.</p>
<p>Ok let's go.</p>
<p>Region not what we want.</p>
<p>This is our last attempt I believe.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Is our last rng chance if we don't get it.</p>
<p>With this.</p>
<p>We use we use our thing which seems weird to use a calibrator on an old character who's a standby character I will admit but at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So let's let's talk and shut today.</p>
<p>No I want her to shut up she's the one who wants shut up she's just like whispering stupid nonsense in the background and it's very irritating ok.</p>
<p>Give me impacts give me impact give me impacts give me impacts give me impacts impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact.</p>
<p>That is.</p>
<p>And be done that is so good we actually got why we got lucky we got so lucky in those last two.</p>
<p>That is a god peace right there.</p>
<p>Pen ratio with pen as a substance it never happens.</p>
<p>Go to all the other streams and tell them I sent you to say.</p>
<p>Spending and you know what's so good about this.</p>
<p>This is genius right here because the interchangeable look at that they have the same sets in the same slots so if one of these pieces we already know that this piece.</p>
<p>Is already better.</p>
<p>I think we'll we'll do some testing but I would imagine so.</p>
<p>I guess why not let's see what.</p>
<p>I would like to see crit.</p>
<p>Pack percent.</p>
<p>Create a 10% we've already got the double defence so I can't give us another defense that's the good news it could still give us hp.</p>
<p>Oh s***.</p>
<p>Whatever just going to penn then.</p>
<p>I hate this game so much.</p>
<p>Pen will you put it in pan.</p>
<p>Thank you ok that's good that's good we have one more roll.</p>
<p>Dodge miku doesn't dodge so she.</p>
<p>My damage now so that's good so you know what that means right she's got 24% pen ratio she's got 27 flat pan on top of that a whole ton of defense which is an ideal but you know i'll take it and now we can go over to me google.</p>
<p>We can give her was it this one.</p>
<p>Yes we can give her this one replace it with andy now andy's got the s*** one which ain't that s*** to be fair to got 18 pen it's got some attack percent and it's got electric damage bonus but it ain't as good as this.</p>
<p>It's amazing.</p>
<p>Ok the next one that could be really useful.</p>
<p>I was really happy with this one actually.</p>
<p>Is everybody else's gear level up I think it is yeah I think it is so it's safe to do this.</p>
<p>So andy's.</p>
<p>I would like to see either pen.</p>
<p>Would be great.</p>
<p>Pen or 10% is what we want to see.</p>
<p>An impact.</p>
<p>Any of these other pieces can we get pen on here.</p>
<p>Ok can we get pen on this one.</p>
<p>We've already got pen on this one.</p>
<p>How would you like that.</p>
<p>Who's laughing now.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>9:10 here these pieces aren't even levelled up yet we got a lot of pen.</p>
<p>Is there any more pens.</p>
<p>Did parker.</p>
<p>Biro.</p>
<p>Who else makes pens.</p>
<p>Feather incorporated ok.</p>
<p>Hit me on the pan.</p>
<p>Give me the pen.</p>
<p>Hp.</p>
<p>Can you give me on this one why does it never roll pin.</p>
<p>I will take that.</p>
<p>All day long.</p>
<p>We don't have pen on this one so this this couldn't possibly be a better piece for me girl.</p>
<p>I don't know the one she's got not great to be honest.</p>
<p>She's got 4.8 crit rate and 38 flat you know what that is actually pretty devastating if i'm being completely honest.</p>
<p>It got one rolling trip will they got one additional rolling one edition.</p>
<p>Could this be miku's weakest piece it's pretty trash it got two roles in the hp.</p>
<p>All right let's see where it goes.</p>
<p>We run out of money.</p>
<p>Build gone along right what this means is when we go into defence line zero or whatever right that's not what it's called the one where you go in the series right when we go in the one in the tv is now we can put both and be and me who.</p>
<p>I'm on the roster and we essentially get our are team quicker because our are team with either and the army goes absolutely fine.</p>
<p>And that's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>That is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>I don't think i'll beat this.</p>
<p>I barely did the first part.</p>
<p>We can try right.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong right.</p>
<p>They're all good actually.</p>
<p>Easy mate the game.</p>
<p>Tell countdown.</p>
<p>Ashley.</p>
<p>That was pretty nice.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me I will catch you next time.</p>
<p>Who is this.</p>
<p>I did see you enemies with we've never thought before who is this.</p>
<p>She's dead.</p>
<p>Aiding.</p>
<p>What is this.</p>
<p>First attempt come on baby.</p>
<p>Hell yeah I did get killed twice like pepper died.</p>
<p>Amy who died ones.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>Yes that's how these workers so you can you can do it with or without getting defeated.</p>
<p>Ok interesting.</p>
<p>Can you hear me.</p>
<p>That was fun.</p>
<p>What a great day for sunless.</p>
<p>Unnecessary and maybe it was.</p>
<p>Do you need her.</p>
<p>The next character name was.</p>
<p>I think that's worthwhile for me because.</p>
<p>Guess my favourite team so my favourite team just got an upgrade.</p>
<p>Quite a significant 1 hours.</p>
<p>First time.</p>
<p>Play cold support unit if either of them come up to help nickel mano.</p>
<p>Then you know I have like.</p>
<p>2/3 of maya team already so that's pretty good.</p>
<p>And that's exactly why I wanted to sort of rebuild and be.</p>
<p>A substitute.</p>
<p>Stone character for my 18 so my team now has because why not right I have already invested massively and I like and be a lot.</p>
<p>Turn on my air team has like two stone characters that'll be ready to go.</p>
<p>And whoever shows up can do the job.</p>
<p>And i'll probably be back on tomorrow at some point.</p>
<p>Thank you for watching i'll catch you next time bye.</p>
